164p5gp,ODA WAS AT THE LA FAN SCREENING,2023-08-29 17:46:52,"A few days ago, people here were asking why did Oda hide his face so much (Like he did in the video where he met I√±aki) and there you have it: So he can go to fan events like these in complete peace and nobody bothers him. I respect that tbh.",242
164p5gp,ODA WAS AT THE LA FAN SCREENING,2023-08-29 17:46:52,"Well at first I was envious of everyone who attended, but now I‚Äôm kinda glad because I‚Äôd be pissed if I found out that I barely missed Oda lol",142

164p5gp,ODA WAS AT THE LA FAN SCREENING,2023-08-29 17:46:52,I can't believe he pulled a Pandaman.,37
164p5gp,ODA WAS AT THE LA FAN SCREENING,2023-08-29 17:46:52,I was respectfully waiting on this image to come out I think I was one of 3 one piece fans who knew of Oda‚Äôs existence and get to see and walk past him. I worked staff for the event so there was twice where I walked past him face to face. Watching his body language he seems to be a very interesting person. I wish I had the opportunity to actually speak to him but his security was pretty tight.,396

164p5gp,ODA WAS AT THE LA FAN SCREENING,2023-08-29 17:46:52,"Dude I was literally 30ft from him and didn‚Äôt even know. That‚Äôs crazy to me still. Didn‚Äôt even notice but that‚Äôs the closest I‚Äôll ever be to him again. Mind blown. I was right behind the red chair section. So freaking cool gave me goosebumps

164p5gp,ODA WAS AT THE LA FAN SCREENING,2023-08-29 17:46:52,"Oda has done more in this promotion for one piece LA than he‚Äôs probably done for anything outside of the manga; he clearly has soo much passion and love for this LA adaption and is proud of the work that the team has put in to re-creating and adapting his story into a different medium.

Also Oda stated and we‚Äôve been told multiple times by the show runners and directors that nothing went past Oda‚Äôs permission he made sure that everything they did was to the highest standards and also made them reshoot entire scenes if he felt it didn‚Äôt align with his vision.

A good example is that apparently Zoro‚Äôs backstory was that the the child actors for Zora and Kuina wore Kendo masks when they were training however Oda told them to go back and redo the entire scene so that we can see their faces; small things like that add to the greater experience.",851
164p5gp,ODA WAS AT THE LA FAN SCREENING,2023-08-29 17:46:52,I was a lil jealous of the screening being held in LA and even a lil more envious that I don‚Äôt have a promo package strawhat.  But now I‚Äôm just puuuuuuurrrrre hatingüò≠.,167
164p5gp,ODA WAS AT THE LA FAN SCREENING,2023-08-29 17:46:52,"Holy shit that‚Äôs awesome; he must have a LOT of confidence and love for this adaption for him to to do something so dangerous; imagine if the fan reception was negative, I assume he‚Äôd be devastated by that since the NY times interview basically highlights how he was practically watching every footage and telling them to re-write and film scenes if he felt they didn‚Äôt line up with his vision.

Clearly he‚Äôs proud of what‚Äôs been produced; no matter what happens I‚Äôm happy that he was able to be apart of an adaption that he enjoys immensely and I hope it helped relight a fire inside of him for this final stretch of the series it must be hard staying motivated after 26 years on one product and doing this may have been a unique and beautiful experience no matter how it‚Äôs received.‚ù§Ô∏è",786
164p5gp,ODA WAS AT THE LA FAN SCREENING,2023-08-29 17:46:52,"I was in the same area as Oda!?!?! The a chance I actually pass by him! Also at the even there was a drawing of luffy being shown with the current date I thought that was weird. Also what a troll he also wrote ""Nice to meet you LA"" on it bro even foreshadowed his presents lol

164p5gp,ODA WAS AT THE LA FAN SCREENING,2023-08-29 17:46:52,There‚Äôs no way that this is Oda. Everyone knows he is 9 feet tall and emits as much light from his presence as the noonday sun does. Plus in this photo there are no flowers blooming instantaneously or fireworks.,211

164p5gp,ODA WAS AT THE LA FAN SCREENING,2023-08-29 17:46:52,"This might explain the reason behind so many breaks for the manga, it looks like a week or so but in reality there are a lot of scheduling behind these events and a lot of process too which makes Oda pretty busy and have no time to keep working on chapters as much as he wants. I feel this is ok, this is big for One Piece aiming to earn new fans around the world.

I hope the OP LA delivers, so many good people worked so hard for this.",437

Bold of him to dress like that. Had I seen a older looking Japanese fellow wearing the signature shorts and sandals at a One Piece event, I would have immediately thought, ""Yo, is that?...""",336

164p5gp,ODA WAS AT THE LA FAN SCREENING,2023-08-29 17:46:52,I love the idea that he was there watching all the happiness and basking in the fan love as an average joe and no one was the wiser because we never see his face. It's so perfect. He was probably so proud,204

164p5gp,ODA WAS AT THE LA FAN SCREENING,2023-08-29 17:46:52,"Woah that‚Äôs interesting. So he went there without most people noticing? I assume that means he was able to keep his face from photographed, which is a good thing of course",171

Zoro‚Äôs cool guy schtick is working surprisingly well, Nami‚Äôs scheming is fun, Usopp is fun as always, the jokes are landing, and I actually teared up a little when they set sail on the Merry.

166675j,The One Piece is Real,2023-08-31 09:24:02,"It's not half bad! I'm going to finish the Netflix episodes and watch a few of the anime episodes. 

I'm about 4 episodes in for the Netflix show, and I enjoy a lot of the characters. I've heard a few say it's more serious than the anime, but that's totally fine since it's 8 episodes and a very expensive show. Netflix is notorious for dropping shows, so I think it's great we get a high quality show first.

I've looked into the anime and manga once or twice. I love pirates obviously, so k tend to peak my head into pirate anime content at times. One piece has 1k episodes lol, so its been a bit intimidating to get into.  I'm optimistic that I'll be seeing more one piece in the future.",690

166675j,The One Piece is Real,2023-08-31 09:24:02,Thank god it‚Äôs good. Luffy and Koby were basically cast to perfection. Only on ep 2 and liking it a lot so far,110

What I freaking like is the introduction of villains with their wanted posters. Awesome thing!",326

166675j,The One Piece is Real,2023-08-31 09:24:02,Damn. Pretty high reviews for a live action. Nice.,50
166675j,The One Piece is Real,2023-08-31 09:24:02,"On episode 4 rn.  The only complaint is that they gave Buggy his nose yet left Usopp's plain.  I don't mean make it dramatic like the manga/anime, but it's his nose that made his character as the person who told lies all the time.",230
166675j,The One Piece is Real,2023-08-31 09:24:02,"So, I am not a real fan, like probably most of you are.
I watched some Anime episodes years ago, and the last thing I remember is the fish guy Arlong, and the battle between all of them.

The coolest thing I was ever fond about is the character design. These ideas! Like the guy always moonwalking... lol!

Need to say, today I watched 5 eps of the Netflix show, and holy shit! In my opinion they NAILED all the main chars!

Props to Netflix! I hope they'll continue.
But what about the nose of Ussop? He doesn't even have this pinnocio nose, and still he somehow is believable :D",580

166675j,The One Piece is Real,2023-08-31 09:24:02,"It's worth noting that because this show has been getting a lot of buzz on social media/tik tok you're going to get reviewers that aren't just not fans of the OP anime, but don't watch or review anime at all. So i'd take their rotten reviews and hot takes with a grain of salt


For instance, this lady who gave it a rotten score has never reviewed anime, but claims ""what can this add that the original does not?""

166675j,The One Piece is Real,2023-08-31 09:24:02,Its shit. The fandom will blow it up though because it's one piece so that's expected to happen but definitely not worth that score.,132

166675j,The One Piece is Real,2023-08-31 09:24:02,For something like this critic ain‚Äôt worth shit. It will go down only audience matter for something like an anime adaptation. Don‚Äôt think much anime would be rated high on a cinematographic perspective.,202

166675j,The One Piece is Real,2023-08-31 09:24:02,"It's pretty good, but god-damn, Luffy's acting is SO bad and unrefined. He keeps looking at the camera, or his eyes dart to 8 places before talking, or this weird determined squint-talking that Luffy never does. He sucks all the immersion out of the show. He feels like a total tourist, just winging it. 

IDC if he was chosen by Oda, he certainly wasn't directed by him. 

Everyone else is awesome so far. Zoro is REALLY REALLY awesome.",437

166675j,The One Piece is Real,2023-08-31 09:24:02,I love OP and i hate to be that person but it definitely doesnt deserve these ratings. Theres so much that couldve been improved upon and its sad cause you guys for the most part will just eat up anything thats OP related. If the original OP never existed and this was its own standalone series the reviews would be a lot different thats all i‚Äôll say.,351
166675j,The One Piece is Real,2023-08-31 09:24:02,"Watched 5 episodes and all I can say it's amazing. The first episode was definitely 10/10. The 2nd episode was still great, but not as good as the first. 3rd and 4th episode were absolutely great, I loved the ""dark"" feeling. I think they should've done more open shots, showing the islands and more of the universe. The fights are insane, group dynamics are getting better and better, villains are all good, and the effects are fantastic... For now it gets a solid 9/10.",470
166675j,The One Piece is Real,2023-08-31 09:24:02,"I want to believe this is good thing to watch. But I can't lie to myself, this is way too generic. The music is underwhelming, the camera works is absurd (the perspective make you feel unease, doesn't give you much information about the settings, and too many weird close up), and the last...the dialog is too generic and not inspiring at all. 

It doesn't live up to the hype. It's okay-ish as a fan service, but as a series? meh.",431

166675j,The One Piece is Real,2023-08-31 09:24:02,One Piece fans will like anything because they enjoy watching One Piece. Their expectations are always all time low. Overrated real action series of an overrated anime.,168
166675j,The One Piece is Real,2023-08-31 09:24:02,"I've watched 1.5 episodes and it's much better than I expected, loving it so far.",81
166675j,The One Piece is Real,2023-08-31 09:24:02,"Man some of yall are weird as fuck lol. Some saying its not close enough to the manga, bro its live action adapting all this material. Changes have to be made. Then some aren't happy with any criticism lol, the show aint perfect, its live action anime and not even something serious like Monster... goofy shonen one piece in live action. Just enjoy it man.

Live action there is thousands of crew people involved and actors working crazy 16hr schedules, and the sets have to be made. They can't just draw the damn environment on the screen unless it's CGI which the most of the sets aren't. CGI is expensive asl too. You can't have a 1 to 1 adaptation of an anime like this. Plus wouldn't it be boring if you knew exactly whats going to happen every second of the show..?

Audience score is fake, no one finished it yet. Critics have the show early but they gonna rate it as critics not fans.
5 Episodes in and it's far from perfect but I'm enjoying it. First few episodes are really rough, but it's fun. As a critic this would like a 6.5/10, as a fan it's 8.5/10.",1064
166675j,The One Piece is Real,2023-08-31 09:24:02,"I was really hyped but I‚Äôm kinda disappointed. The biggest turn-off for this live action is the writing. They are going so fast that they have to make up so unrealistic situations. For example right at the start with Morgan. He wasn‚Äôt really a bad guy, still he got convicted for only not being able to stop pirates (wtf?!). After when they go to meet Usopp, if someone haven‚Äôt watched the anime, his lying nature may not be highlighted enough beforehand. Also, why does Kuro just reveal himself right after the Straw Hats arrive? No point of this.
This live action should not cover that many parts so that they have more time unraveling the story.",648

Oda has a signature overlay with name and rank etc. whenever a new main character is seen, I think they should have done a Guy Richie esk freeze with a name and rank overlay. Would have made intros to people like buggy, Garp and more super stylised and cool.",379

I'd say 6-7/10

Its good but not great, misses a lot of impactful scenes and gets hard to follow in places.

I really liked Sanji and surprisingly Usopp (who I don't normally like), and Zoro, Nami and Luffy were fine.

I'd watch a second season, but I hope they pace it a bit better, felt like too much too fast as opposed to the slow and drawn out anime, they need a better happy medium.",426
166675j,The One Piece is Real,2023-08-31 09:24:02,A show made by fans for everybody,33
166675j,The One Piece is Real,2023-08-31 09:24:02,"Ok, I am currently done with episode 5: my thoughts so far including spoilers so be warned: 
1. Actors are amazing. Love how they interact, they feel like people who would end up in a friend group by accident which really helps it.
2. Cinematography is phenomenal, the sets are insanely well done. 
3. Buggy even better in LA and idc what anyone says. 
4. I do dislike how mihawk is portrayed and introduced from being a dude just fucking around to being sent to hunt luffy by garp. Garp would 100% know Mihawk would end up killing luffy with how luffy is as a fighter. 
5. The way Syrup village was done was honestly super fun. I enjoy the marines actually doing something about luffy after he took out Morgan. 
6. Helmeppo actor is cracked. 
7. The biggest complaint I‚Äôve got so far: Nami didn‚Äôt ditch when she was meant to which imo is a majorly important part to East blue which sets up the end of it, but I haven‚Äôt finished so i can still be changed on that point. 
8. The CGI is fucking amazing compared to what I expected out of it, glad they got the budget and time to make this so great.
9. I do like the addition of more Koby and him and Garp. I like thinking garp did wanna chase luffy to whoop his ass. I wonder if we get a water 7 scene early where he gets his dad name dropped",1290

Do not trust Netflix anymore to what they did with the Witcher. First and second seasons are miles apart, third season is not even in the same dimension.

The true test for the series will be adapting Alabasta, and not falling to SJW pandering.",313
166675j,The One Piece is Real,2023-08-31 09:24:02,"I am glad a lot of people are enjoying it but I just didn't like it at all.

I understand that they had to make certain adjustments in order to bring One Piece ""to life"" but a lot of the plot changes were just straight up terrible and unnecessary. Revealing that Garp is Luffy's grandfather, having Arlong show up at the Baratie instead of Nami leaving / running away which was an important part of her character arc, Having Buggy stick around as the annoying Mimir of this show ... I don't know.

The character looks also were basically either terrible or spot on with very little inbetween and the same for the acting. It was either really good or straight up bad.

The fishmen look was a mixed bag for me. On the one hand I like that they were mostly practical instead of going for some bad CG. But again, a show this expensive should have better make-up than Star Trek shows from 30 years ago.

And the make-up wasn't the only thing that looked incredibly cheap at times. The costumes, weapons, sets and a lof of the effects were just awful and took me out of the show instantly. How is it that hobby cosplayers can put together better costumes than a Netflix show.

I was also down on the fights as most of them were badly put together and lacking any really good choreography one should expect from a show with this per episode price tag.

The best moments of the show were the ones that stuck as closely to the source material as possible.

This show by itself didn't do a thing for me.

Again, if you enjoyed it then I am happy for you and don't mean to bring you down but I think it should be allowed to voice a different viewpoint on this.",1649

This is anecdotal, but I live in Japan, and it's also been a huge hit for all of my Japanese friends here. A few of them who also bounced off the manga or anime have already binged the entire season and can't wait for more.

But the show won me over and I just finished episode 8. Its filled with soul and its obvious while watching that the cast and crew have a lot of love for the source material. Reminds me a bit of the OG Lord of the Rings trilogy where you can feel the love and passion for the source material and fanbase oozing out of the screen.

1) OP manga/anime Fans will watch it, see the small adaptations that surpringly work pretty well and do not change anything that matters and their only cravings are that the series needs more budget to do more devil fruit effects to make the fights cooler.

2) Having the auther closely oversight the proyect ensure that no classic fckups are done to crowdplease (and fck up the actual essence of OP)

3) Newcomer that never watched OP who will want to see what comes next will also start watching anime or even read the manga which creates an audience that wants season 2+. it's a win-win-win situation

From the second link, it seems it is a real-time thing (daily top) and the show was expected by many people, so if the ratings only consider people who watched the first episode, being number 1 is not so surprising, even if the show was bad and people hated it. (Pretty sure the last season of Game of Thrones or Casa de papel: Korea, started very well)

You see several times how massive big fights are reduced to a different storyline because it would have been an CGI and Extras-Nightmare to produce that for a series.

>!Just take the fight against the cat-pirates. We moved from a fight with a complete crew on an open shore to a close quarter fight inside a house with three villains. Or how basically all of Don Creek was completly skipped.!<

The cuts and changes are very understandable to make this adaptation possible, but it takes away a lot of the grandeur of One Piece scenes we are familiar with.

Why set this one at night? What benefit did they think that‚Äôd add to the shot? Usopp not hanging his head as low I understand because you want the actor‚Äôs face to be visible. But Sanji is facing the complete other direction. Having him stand like he does in the other two versions wouldn‚Äôt take away anything from the shot. Zoro‚Äôs pose here is also just so stupid. In the other two, he‚Äôs resting his head on his sword. In the manga he‚Äôs leaning back and in the anime he‚Äôs leaning forward, both looked relaxed in different ways. In the live action one, it looks like he‚Äôs literally just holding his sword to his forehead. Also, why change the direction he‚Äôs holding the sword in? And Nami in the background is also facing the wrong direction for some reason; surely having your actor turn their back towards the camera instead of sitting in a profile view is objectively worse, kinda like why I assume they changed Usopp‚Äôs pose.

Its the Medium that does undynamic poses the best by having the creative liberty of adding excessive VFX without it feeling wrong.

She‚Äòs much more likable and can actually defend herself and doesn‚Äòt shy away from a fight. It makes it more believable that she would join a pirate crew to go across the Grand Line and find the One Piece. 

The casting is brilliant so far. I really like everyone and they didn‚Äòt change much. At least nothing substantial. And while the show does look a little cheap sometimes, you can really tell how much love they put into it and you really don‚Äòt care about those iffy shots that much.",615

15z47no,First look at the Live Action Den Den Mushi,2023-08-23 13:38:31,"Two things spring to my mind.

First, one of the things that continuously makes me hopeful for this show is the sheer number of props, physical sets, and practical effects we've seen. In an era where some studios are happy to just slap some bad CGI into their movie/show and call it a day, the love and care that you have to put into making even halfway decent props gives it an extra level of charm. I'm absolutely thrilled with the Den Den Mushi.

Second, one of the things that I always think is kind of cool about seeing readaptations of long running series like One Piece is that the new adaptation has better knowledge of the future than the original run and they can work in elements introduced later on earlier into the narrative and tighten some of the foreshadowing. Den Den Mushi, for as iconic as they are, didn't actually first show up until chapter 94. It's neat to see the live action work them into the setting earlier on to make the world building more cohesive.",979

It might be worth x but it may also take time to sell. Its worth what someon is willing to pay however determining that number is the trick. If you had several of these a really good way to do that is auction off the first and set your prices baded off of how it ends. 

Similarly you can look at prices of sold things, thats completed listings ie what some onenhas already agreed to pay. Do not go by current listings they mean nothing. People can list stuff for sale at any price its not a good gage of what people will pay or an items worth. 

That being said plastic or vinyl (which is cheap to produce) one piece figures that are not hand made can really easily go for 200 some higher end ones  300 +  i think scale matters here 
Im not a figure guy but i think you could safely price your work around there and people would certainly bite pretty quickly. Now highlighting its handmade, one of a kind with province ( proof you made it) will certainly increase the value. Its also a really great design. 

Since the value is to be determined i might consider an auction if I were you making sure you properly let people know its posted depending on how quick ypu meed the cash  or list at a fixed price somewhere with OBO (or best offer) so which is basicly the same as an auction but less formal and maybe quicker.",1396

This was my one complaint with the episode but it didn‚Äôt ruin it for me or anything. You could kind of see what they were trying to do with luffy‚Äôs panel where he gets scared at the incoming blast breath, but they made it happen so fast you couldn‚Äôt tell what was happening. If they would just lay off the flashing lights a hair and embrace the goofiness, I think less people would probably be complaining about it",450
15kpkl4,"My little brother had a hard time following that scene, so I trimmed it down and thought I'd share it here as well",2023-08-07 16:29:21,"Bruh, this is so much better than the original and the worse part is that they added recap and reuse animation to pad the runtime yet the actual ""good scenes"" happened too fast for viewers to really understand what was happening.

But no, they ""overanimate"" this specific action sequence, really sad.  


Great edit, I think the images themselves look good and it is well animated, just not set-up properly in my opinion. Really missed potential.",414

15kpkl4,"My little brother had a hard time following that scene, so I trimmed it down and thought I'd share it here as well",2023-08-07 16:29:21,"Thanks a ton for the positive feedback!!! I had no idea you felt strongly about this scene (in both aspects).

If anyone was wondering, the few key things I did with the edit : 

* Removed the frames were Luffy was too blurry or where his face was jumping all around after he was moonwalking.
* Rearranged a few cuts to make the scene flow a little better ( I am no expert by any means so I went with my guts)
* Added an inverted cut of the the initial blast breath's impact on the rubber wall to signify that it was starting to bounce back
* Funnily enough I didn't intentionally slow down the video, that happened when I converted it to a Gif so that it can be inserted as an image in the post.

Whether you liked or disliked the episode or the edit, let's all keep celebrating One piece for weeks to come! Cheers!",816

15kpkl4,"My little brother had a hard time following that scene, so I trimmed it down and thought I'd share it here as well",2023-08-07 16:29:21,Nice that they used a scene 3 times to fill the screen time,59

15kpkl4,"My little brother had a hard time following that scene, so I trimmed it down and thought I'd share it here as well",2023-08-07 16:29:21,"Nice work. I think what they were going for with the more chaotic original was some kind of struggle with Kaido trying to drag them back to ""epic anime style"" animation and luffy trying to keep them in ""loony toons style"" animation, so the chaotic weirdness in the sequence was supposed to be the 2 animation styles both trying to dominate, or something like that. I think it's a cool idea but ended up super visually confusing in practice",439

15kpkl4,"My little brother had a hard time following that scene, so I trimmed it down and thought I'd share it here as well",2023-08-07 16:29:21,"I gotta say Toei butchered this sequence entirely. The manga is perfectly smooth how it translates to your brain you immediately understand what happened. Rewatched it on slow-mo since I thought Luffy made two walls because the ground is already up before the next scene of Luffy preparing to stretch it in muscle mode.

Boro breath is the weirdest thing they have it go straight through the rubber wall jittering around (Again what gave me the impression it broke through continuing its direction to Luffy and that he was preparing a second one to deflect it).

Replayed sequences of doing a motion that already happened to represent speed makes sense but it throws me off how they didn't have the stretched ground wrap around the Boro Breath until a couple frames at the end",776

But as a scene in an episode THIS just feels a lot more pleasant to watch! Thematically it'd make sense that the episode is chaotic because G5 is chaotic and wild and free, but the episode went a bit too much into the chaos for my liking.

Speaking of the making the episode better to watch: I had to go frame by frame to catch this but after Luffy's eyes popping out he grabs them and shoves them back in. That's why you go from his eyes popping out to suddenly his arms flying back: the whole gag lasts a grand total of 20 frames, with plenty of good shots that should've been visible for more than a blink of an eye!",683

i stopped watching one piece during dressrosa and switched to the manga because the anime was boring. but at least there were still some good clippable moments from dressrosa and whole cake island that manga readers could watch. it was mainly just a pacing issue, obviously. but holy shit, i could never have possibly fathomed just how bad the one piece anime would get during wano. 



the directing sucks ass, the animation makes no sense, the editing is terrible, and the sound effects and music are out of place and seemingly chosen at random. did an AI make this anime? honestly, i dont know enough about the animation process to say whats worse: the storyboards or the animation. i guess i would say the storyboards, because that decides the timing of everything? because some of the moment-to-moment animation is fine, like in another scene when luffy goes muscular and punches kaido and his eyes fly out. and some of the character animation is good if you ignore everything happening around it. but i dont know, maybe the main storyboarders and animators are getting fucked by the director/editor or something. if anyone knows more about the animation process, can you explain what the hell happened since whole cake island?





its definitely better without sound, thats for sure. maybe fans could add in some sound effects and music that actually fit the scenes?",1735

If I can be honest, was not a fan of the direction in this episode. TONS of padding in the form of repeated animations and unnecessary flashback montages.

That being said the showcase for G5 itself was simply outstanding. All animators involved really took the core concept behind G5 and ran with it, as they should. Joyboy transcends reality and embodies freedom to the fullest, and that's how I felt when I saw it in action.",589

15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,toei can't have good pacing even for such a major episode,57
15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,"So just a real analysis:

I think having multiple big shot animators in one episode made it feel like everyone had to contribute so their ideas blended but the execution shows an inconsistent flow and I believe that‚Äôs why a lot of people feel ‚Äúdizzy‚Äù or ‚Äúconfused‚Äù on the perspective of what they‚Äôre watching. It feels like a disorganized hodgepodge of ideas than a consistent narration. There are huge frame style differences that don‚Äôt transition well but feel like they are inserted at that moment because it was time for that director to shine. 

Example: Luffy struggling momentarily to return the blast so we get a crazy camera panning of him in a very unique style. Then when he returns the blast we suddenly get yet another camera panning of his side and back without seeing his face. This is done with a different style, in a questionable timed sequence, right as Kaido is hit with the returned blast. This all happens in the same scenery within seconds of each other. Why did we need two camera pans of Luffy in the same exact spot with two different styles of animation techniques?

It would be like if your 5 friends decided to all partake in writing an essay and in the most important paragraph they all decide to write one sentence each for the novelty of ‚Äúteamwork‚Äù. For some odd reason, in two neighboring sentences - two of your friends make the same point twice but in their own unique wording. I feel like this is what we watched.

Kudos to the team that worked on it tho - still a big milestone and i‚Äôm sure they worked hard on it. Any form of art should be open to criticism and this is my just analysis as to why so many people might be having trouble enjoying what they are trying to watch.",1713
15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,Seems like the next episode will be much better. One piece animators always make it seem like they never have enough to make an episode perfect.,144
15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,"They should've moved that Hiyori half to the previous episode somehow, leave this one entirely for Gear 5, they knew how hype and important this episode would be. Yes I know that's how it was in the manga, but it just killed the whole vibe. Plus repeated scenes, flashbacks, usual suspects...

Yes, the animation was cool and flashy but I've noticed the usual syndrome of being hard to follow and not very comprehensible. It tries to be fluid with a lot of motion but it just creates a visual mess. Overall I was left a bit disappointed craving for more. But still, what a historic moment! We're finally here after all this waiting!

Also, where are the soundtracks from the Wano OST, ""Luffy's Awakening"" and ""Awakened Performance""? I was waiting to hear those all this time.",775
15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,"What were they thinking with the pacing? The Hiyori stuff should've been in a previous episode. 

Then after all the hype up of ""they've been working on this ep for 7 months"" it's clustered with reused animations, flashbacks and then big moments like bouncing back the blast breath are a complete and utter visual mess with poor framing and motion damn near impossible to follow.

- the new sound effects were mixed pretty poorly. They just sounded cheap, as if someone was pressing a button over and over to play it, rather than it sounding actually organic and in their world. Then again, a lot of one piece sfx are like this. It‚Äôs not Toei‚Äôs strong suit.

- I loved the emphasis on Luffy‚Äôs haki. It felt really powerfully and impactful at the beginning of the episode.

- Luffy‚Äôs VA was the best part. Absolutely insane work!

- Way too much time spent on Hiyori and flashbacks for an episode that‚Äôs touted to have an insane amount of animators on it. 

- reused animations in the beginning felt very jarring 

- seeing Luffy blow into his arm before pulling up Kaido took out the surprise of seeing a giant arm suddenly grabbing Kaido. This was done better in the manga.

- the boro breathe rebound scene was way too fast and poorly directed. it‚Äôs way too hard to tell what‚Äôs happening with a fresh eye. The looney toons shot of Luffy‚Äôs eyes popping out was way too quick, like what? 

- so many close ups. 

- the music was pretty good

- the text reveal for gear 5 was really cool",1242

They practically showed the same scene thrice of Luffy jumping around in the same episode and did we really needed a long flashback of what happened at the end of previous episode?

15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,"This was meant to be the peak of the Wano arc but Toei made it into another weekly episode. 

Before the issues I want to start with a positive: Luffy‚Äôs voice actor did an amazing job this episode and brought gear 5th to life. 

Where to start. Tons of flashbacks? The flashbacks were waaay too long for an episode this important.

CGI Kaido still? I‚Äôd understand for a normal episode but there was behind the scenes for this saying that they had lots of people from around the world working on it. This had been advertised by Toei. This was meant to be something huge, yet the production quality felt lower than previous wano episodes.

I think the soundtrack was ok but also wasn‚Äôt anything memorable. 

Bad pacing again? Why not add in scenes like in 1015. Instead, scenes are stretched out again making the whole episode feel slow. There were multiple scenes with Luffy that were reused within the same episode.
 
Even with all of the well animated scenes, those scenes were so hard to follow. They were flashy and that‚Äôs it. If I hadn‚Äôt read the manga previously I feel like I would have found it hard to follow what was happening in the fights. It felt like animation for the sake of it. Its clear that a lot of time and effort went into those scenes but the poor direction made it so hard to follow most of them.",1319
15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,"I think Toei needs to understand only one detail to make an outstanding episode: DON'T REUSE ANIMATION!

The long flashbacks, the Luffy bouncing is cool but was played THREE TIMES!

Just think about 1015, sanji, zoro or law/kid episodes, those were peak because they didn't reuse animations, if there was flashback it was REANIMATED.

&#x200B;

Also, the bouncing Bolo Breath was massively confusing. If I have to bet, It was the cut given to Vincent Chansard at the last minute. The production is rushing hard.",511

The Orochi scene was also in the manga so not much can be done about that but the reused scenes of him bouncing around and flashbacks to the previous episode were unnecessary.

15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,"I honestly think this was the worst in-episode gear reveal yet. Too bad, since I think the manga has the best overall gear reveal with Gear 5. Gear 2 was obviously amazing in anime, Gear 3 gets little love but I'll never forget when Luffy punched Lucci through a building and onto a ship, and Gear 4 sent Doffy flying through Dressrosa - and the animation showed all that weight well. Gear 5 reused animations enough to kill immersion, and was so close up and slow-paced compared to how fast it feels in the manga that you're kind of confused as to what is even going on at any moment. The initial transformation is great, but everything after felt like too many corners cut on perhaps the most important episode in the series.

Edit: For clarity's sake, I was sitting in bed laughing and smiling the whole way through. I really enjoyed the episode, and thought it was among the most memorable of the arc of course, but cannot help feeling a lot of disappointment since Toei did drop the ball a bit here. If they could make a perfect episode for Zoro v King, then why not for Luffy? And I felt disappointed as well in Sanji vs Queen's portrayal considering almost no blood is shown and overall, there's a lack of weight.

I think the ending of the Komurasaki speech transitioned well into the fight, but by the 3rd time she said a variant of the same ""my father kept his word and played the fool"" line, it was long in the tooth. I get it's weekly, but with how they played it up I was honestly expecting most of the episode to be the animators giving us wacky scenes ad-libbing Gear 5ths creativity. Expectations can mess anything up, and I think I expected this episode to be a complete departure from the typical episode in ways that they just couldn't do for a weekly.

Once we got there though, G5 was phenomenal. Boy everything about that reflected Blast Breath was amazingly well animated, and the comedy landed too. Loved that quick shot of Kaido in full color giving the ""Buggy face"" at the breath getting reflected back at him. From the second Luffy yoinked Kaido out of the sky, to the final standoff, I had a huge grin and really had a blast watching.

I just can't give this episode a 10/10.

there are just too many flaws that are too glaring to overlook.

I want to talk about the good, and ironically Hiyori and Orochi was actually one of the good parts of this episode. it uses its time nicely and concluded the conflict between these two.

second, the animation is crazy good and I love the cartoon sound effects. 

but I gotta talk about the bad.

pacing is still a big problem and the 3 repeating animations of Luffy getting used to gear 5th, no matter how smooth it looks, still scream ""we're padding this episode out"". There's also that scene with luffy saying gear 5th and they had to spell out the letters ""gear 5"". If there's one thing I hope doesn't carry over into the next arc, it's this. these over-the-top introductions of techniques accompanied by flashbacks. it's honestly as bad as swing-sama from naruto.

while I did say the animation was a good part of this episode, it's also a bad part as well. it's just way too much. it's overperforming when it doesn't need to and I hate to say that because I know it took a lot of effort to make these scenes and I want to honor the animator who spent so much time on this episode. But these scenes of over-the-top animation feel like eating a very rich and decadent cake. There's no questioning the flavor is delicious, but each bite is so sickeningly rich and fattening that you feel like you're gonna die from a heart attack from how overly sweet and fattening it is.",1527

The entire first sequence with Luffy waking up was beyond words I don‚Äôt know how to describe it. The visual of the lightning and the CoC going off, Luffy like, passively sending out ridiculous amounts of haki was awe-inspiring and really help to illustrate the power and gravity of Gear 5.

The parts that weren‚Äôt so great were, not so great. I anticipated that the Hiyori bit would kill the pacing a little bit but holy shit did that fucking murder all the hype. What felt like a tiny dip in the manga was like a bullet train hitting a brick wall in the anime.

Also the animation towards the end got to be a bit much. The scene where Luffy bounces back the Blast Breath was bad, obviously it was well animated but it was way too busy chill the fuck out for two seconds. It felt like there were a bunch of animators trying to make their mark and it led to the episode being a mess at times.

It was a great episode in total, the highs were astronomically high, but the lows while not too bad were still lower than they should‚Äôve been. I enjoyed it but it really needed to be perfect and I don‚Äôt think it was.",1185

If they showed that one sequence of Luffy jumping around for like a fourth time I would have started laughing like Luffy myself.     
For the most part the G5 stuff was great. Only gripes: Toei needs a bigger Looney Tunes sound board and please cut it out with the cooky/erratic/constantly-shifting camera angles. That scene of Luffy reflecting Kaido's fire was just too much, imo.

15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,Toei keeps doing the closeups and overly animated scenes. This doesn't work at all with G5 IMO which is wholly based on a very specific animation style.,152

I‚Äôm gonna be honest here and say that the director, as much praise as they OUGHT be given, completely diminished Hyiori‚Äôs incredibly emotional and powerful scene with Orochi. 

The way it played out was basically just a time-filler for the episode rather than a genuinely tear jerking scene where she is screaming her name and identity, only seconds after taking off the mask that represented her alter ego that she had to hide behind for 20 years.

I mean I get it. She is a side character, and her scene is awkwardly placed after a crazy revelation, and before an omega crazy fight sequence.  

I just wished they planned for it when dealing with the energy distribution for the episode.",760
15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,"This actually worked better in the manga than in the anime.

It's fun to finally see Gear 5. However, this episode was rife with issues. I'll talk about my main gripe, as others have mentioned repeating animation loops and such.

The main problem for me during the Luffy and Luffy/Kaido sequences are that there seems to be no discipline and economy in capturing the action. It is incredibly fast-paced and becomes jumbled; the former doesn't have to be an issue, but it becomes problematic when paired with the latter. Anyone that hasn't read the manga will have no chance in hell to keep track of what's happening.

It can be argued that this is precisely what they aimed for, to highlight the chaotic nature of gear 5, but in that case they still missed the mark. Apart from Luffy's initial awakening before grabbing Kaido, there is no clarity of animation. You cannot tell what is actually going on, as the cuts are rapid fire; there are either not enough frames to establish many individual shots, or there is no balance between moving parts and stillness in the individual shots. It's all an incredibly confusing mess. The viewer should not be put in the same position as the other characters, and is not served by just watching flashing lights and shifting colors.

I appreciate that they seem to have gone for a specific choice, which is absolute chaos and the introduction of the classic cartoon style. But even that demands discipline in terms of animating said chaos, and definitely in balancing the telltale facets of classic cartoon animation vs. the current modern style. 

In terms of the plotting, I think they would have been better served to push the Hiyori/Orochi into the next episode. Not only do they risk losing the viewer, but they also lose episode running time and narrative momentum, which they needed both to create ""crispier"" animation sequences that just steamrolled towards the episode's end.

Looking forward to the next one!",1957

Going overboard with aura falls under the same category, too. I find myself checking out when an episode has 70% of the screen covered in some aura effect or another.

Then the little amount of actual fighting we got to see, we didn't actually see because it was made so hard to follow along with the visuals that you had no idea what was actually happening!!! Not to mention, they still used Kaido's garbage CGI thing. All in all, this episode was extremely overhyped, I was excited for two months, and now that I've seen it there's nothing else that I can do then say that the episode sucked worse than the Foxy Arc and wait for next week.

15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,I‚Äôm ngl I was super let down by this episode. The animation for gear 5th was amazing but everything else about this episode was drawn out so ridiculously long with so much repeated animation and whole scenes and flashbacks that it completely ruined the hype for this episode for me. I really really like how it‚Äôs animated but for this episode to have been in production for as long as it has and for there to be so much hype built up for this big moment I was just very let down. I‚Äôm super excited for the upcoming episodes and to see more of gear 5 but this introduction episode itself was just a letdown for the hype that was built up for it to me at least.,659
15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,"Is it me or was luffys face weirdly out of frame for most of the episode?  
also the bolo breath sequence was so badly paced to the point where I couldn't tell what was going on, and I read the manga.

the way they handled the first impressions of gear 5 disappointingly reminds me of when they first showed advanced Conquerors haki.I cant believe that 1015 and 1062 are actually better than the biggest reveal of the series.I still have faith in how they will manage the rest of it but they should honestly check in on the director because this is really bad


Edit: Episode is much better on a second watch",608

Tbh I would have preferred if they added some parts of next chapter instead of reusing the same animation, but they have their own restrictions. So no fault on them.

This episode made me hate orochi even more, taking precious time away from luffy's gear 5.",430
15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,Unpopular opinion. I didn't like the episode. Especially the fight scenes with Luffy. The scenes were so fast and the animation so different that I couldn't comprehend. I read the manga and I was waiting so much for this episode but it was kinda of disappointing. I hope the next is better,289
15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,Well that was a fucking disappointment.,39

15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,"# Confusing & somewhat disappointing!!

That's how Id sum up this episode.  As much as I liked how they animated Gear 5. It was downplayed heavily by that Hiyori scene and all those reused scenes throughout. The pacing was also quite slow. Like that scene where the Nika fruit was mentioned by the Gorosei. This.....Fruit......is....called.....the.....hito.....hito....no...mi  - like wtf.

Because of that this episode felt like a filler, trailer episode getting ready to show G5 in 1072.  Instead of serving to build up hype up for G5 for the following episode which it failed on this week.

To make things worse - the pacing and filler this episode was so bad that it affected the content in a confusing way. Luffy grabbing Kaido in the Manga looked way better, so did the lifting of the ground to block the boro breath.

Compared to the fast and continuous fight with Zoro v King. That fight didnt have a lot of flashbacks. It focused on one thing and layered the episode up.

I was sighing midway through this G5 episode ngl,  because it genuinely felt boring since they werent building the hype up with it's slow pacing and it's focus on filler and padding.",1163

15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,"I think the episode was pretty good .. the problem was that people were hyping it up way too much‚Ä¶

I had no expectations and I enjoyed what was given..
They tried a different direction of the animation.
I just hope they are not discouraged by the folks who are disappointed..",313
15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,"On one hand, it's technically well animated. But it felt so damn incoherent. I had no idea what the hell was happening around the time when Luffy bounces back the Bolo breath.",175
15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,"Never did I want to see Toei animate something slower. 

Instead of repeating the same bouncing scene 3 times, if they gave a few more stills it would have been better in my opinion.

The camera angles were well done but with how erratic the movements were, trying to follow some of the shots were difficult to understand what was going on.

The sound work was amazing and Luffy's VA knocked it out the park, but I don't feel fulfilled for the amount of hype I placed on the episode myself. 

Too much of a good thing had just about stopped it from becoming animation history.

In no way was the episode bad, or even close to being bad. But, if I had to chose which version, anime or manga I prefer, I would pick manga.",719
15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,"This is the first time I've been actually disappointed with the animators and direction since Wano started. 

It's not with how confusing the Nika sequences actually were. It's not that it seems like they focused way too much on certain manga panels, like Nika covering his eyes laughing, or reused animation. 

It's how, when we finally focus on Luffy's face, he has all the animated charisma of an edgy car decal. He doesn't look like someone I can't help but laugh with.",473

Then he grabs the ground but his body is now so rubbery and he's not used to his new elasticity, he rockets toward the ground so fast his mouth flies off.  Then the instant he hits the ground which is now rubber bounces super fast like a trampoline pulling the ground up with him . Boro breath isn't slow so this was all quick.

15jdl92,One Piece: Episode 1071,2023-08-06 02:11:07,"I loved the episode, it was fantastic, but man, this could have been way better, specially with all the hype they did..my main gripes:   


1- Hiyori: I didn't liked thaaat much the placement of this scene in the manga, but I just  hated in the anime, in the manga we didn't watched too much of Luffy G5 at this point, basically just his silhouette in the moon...so it didn't break the flow that much..  but in the anime the build up was different with a lot of shots of Luffy,  and I think they could have inserted this scene in aaaaany other place , (they have done this before) hell, even at the very start of the next episode.. idk.. anywhere but in the middle..  


2- Flashbacks and repeated scenes (3 times , really?..)  


3- The ""Luffy deflecting the Boro Breath"" scene‚Ä¶ boy.. just wtf did I just watched?, yes in terms of animation was great but it was too damn fast and erratic, i had to explain my gf (non manga reader) and show her the manga so she can understand better what happened in that scene‚Ä¶ I mean he is a cartoon now but even cartoons have a smooth and clean animation.  


With that said It was still a great episode, full of really amazing moments, I had a big grin every Luffy scene, they really captured the essence of the Gear 5, and that iconic titled Gear 5 panel animated was ON POINTüî•‚Ä¶  


Best thing of the episode: Mayumi Tanaka, what a great performance, God give this woman a long , happy and healthy life.  


As any manga reader know, the real shit begins next episode 1072, which is directed by none other than Ishitani herself, so I expect a top tier episode, even better than this one (I think anime only would not be satisfied tho lol, specially people that thought this was going to be some Ultimate Super Saiyan Ultra Instinct Shinigami Kurama power up lol)",1801

There's nothing that makes this scene good. Sanji has a weird accent for no reason. That's gonna get super annoying for sure. 

Sanji never gets this pissed off at his dad in the anime. He gets annoyed, yes, but he doesn't get angry, which is very clearly what he is here. (He does in the flashback, but not in the kitchen).

Also there's a black dude in the kitchen. Everyone at Baratie in the anime is white. So this also opens up the doors for the live action to go woke. Not for it's main characters it would seem. But it looks like some minor/side characters are gonna have a different race to appeal to the minorities and hence be woke. Starts off as a random character nobody remembers the name of, then becomes someone somewhat significant like Robin later on. (Robin is actually an interesting example cause she has brown skin until a certain point and then it's completely white, so my guess is that she's gonna be played by someone with brownish skin, but this can't really be called woke, so it's also a bad example.)

They said they were gonna stick to the anime, and that, to me, does not look like the case at all. I think this is gonna be something that everyone watches, but something that nobody ever re-watches or shows it to their friends to get them into one piece. That's my bet.

Edit: Nvm, the dude ain't white in the anime either.",1441

\^Loved seeing this because its showing Luffy is slowly reaching the peak of the most famous pirates like Roger and Xebec. 

Probably not fully related to this post but it is to the panel OP is showing.>!I think they're laughing because there isn't any treasure on Laugh tale and One piece is a metaphor for ""The treasure was the friends and adventures you made along the way."" Hence why their first reaction to reaching inland was just to laugh as in ""Wow we really went on a daring adventure for the greatest treasure ever just for it not to exist?! hahaha i can't wait to make a tale out of this!"" Roger wants everyone to experience the adventure he did. This is just my theory though.!<",817

-luffy‚Äôs shenanigans are kept to minimum

-many fight scenes occur inside

-most outside fight scenes take advantage of their biggest sets.

-zoomed in camera so you don‚Äôt see much of the village(sometimes blurring the background like EP3)

They were able to do east blue story very well within budget but it makes you wonder how the hell they are gonna pull off Alabasta? Having a constant CG character(Chopper) around is gonna be budget nightmare, as well as all the actions since fights become more flashy.

We can speculate that if Oda didnt make so many treitary characters for mugiwaras and didnt try to put everyone into some duel the pace wouldve been faster. But I understand him.

It took two years to go from pre-ts to post-ts strength wise. Not just for the crew, but every Supernova crew. I would argue that most Supernovas (Drake, Hawkins, Apoo, Urouge) were near to or even posaibly above the SHs and Law at that time being that they were already in their positions relative to Kaido / Urouge already beat Snack, a lower-yier YC.  At the very least Drake was a Tobi Roppo, and while his showing at Wano wasn't great, he was above Ulti who Luffy was about to go Gear 4th for

A lot of the timeskip has been the crew stomping their opponents (or getting stomped by the big bad) so finally getting good even 1v1s makes it feel more even, but Doffy's top officers besides Vergo were so far below him. The weaker Strawhats were able to beat characters who were at least on their level is both kinda crazy and kinda underwhelming considering how easily Zoro, Kyros and Law took them out

Gear 4th being able to pound Doffy muddles his scaling relative to a YC, but they went from the Monster Trio and Law getting dismantled by Doffy in 1v1s to soloing stronger characters at a disadvantage and Luffy even becoming Yonkou tier OUTSIDE OF his Gear 5 awakening

They really grow tremendously in the heart of battle. It's a shame most of the crew never gets those chances lol, just imagine how strong they'd be if they got to sharpen their iron more",1502

15lpv75,TBH Luffy is a lot of times goofy,2023-08-08 18:16:36,there‚Äôs a balance tho. and it‚Äôs not just Luffy . One piece is goofy. Remember when Zoro used Usopp as a sword in Enies Lobby. Or when Sanji turned to stone after seeing boa. Sanji kicked a guy handsome once. None of that would justify if Zoro and Sanji became Cartoon Characters.,279
15lpv75,TBH Luffy is a lot of times goofy,2023-08-08 18:16:36,"I don't mind it being goofy but one of the things I loved about Luffy was that he was defeating people with super OP devil fruits with just being what seemed like a mid paramecia fruit. It was Luffy's trickery and imagination what pushed the limits of what being a rubber man could do. 

The whole Nika thing is like... We all knew that Luffy was gonna defeat the World Government, no need to give him a super Saiyan transformation with a chosen one background.

I mean is no deal breaker anyway I still love Luffy and One Piece just feel it was kinda unnecessary retconning his devil fruit powers to put him on the same level as Kaido",635

Luffy may have done crazy stuff like biting stuff for example, but the tone always was serious in all these big battles compared to Kaido where it is outright Tom & Jerry. You can argue that Luffy always been a goofball, but you‚Äòd be lying to yourself if you pretend the mood wasn‚Äôt different in all his previous big battles compared to Kaido‚Äòs and Luffy didn‚Äôt turn serious and stop being goofball when shit got serious.",601

Like vs arlong or vs lucci if luffy had gear 5 then it would have been so detrimental to the heavy feelings carried in these fights. You could feel luffy rage and anger through all of it even with crocodile but here luffy is laughing while yasuie is rotting underground ashura doji and izo got clapped and kaido is about to enslave more children and poor people to death.

Probably because he changed after losing his friends and ace. He lost alittle of his care freeness as he realized there where bigger fish in the pond.

Oh yeah Zoan fruits, Chopper went monster point then became super weak and couldn't move as a result of over using his devil fruit, Luffy goes Gear 4th then losses his ability to use haki for 10 minutes (we thought it was haki related but it was actually Luffy's fruit rebounding because his body was not caught up to his fruits abilities) Luffy goes Chibi after using Gear 3rd, what other Devil fruit ever had a downside like that?

15lpv75,TBH Luffy is a lot of times goofy,2023-08-08 18:16:36,"Lmfao Luffy‚Äôs fights serious? Okay lets be realistic here:

Arlong? Bro took arlongs teeth from him and stomped himself into the ground to be made into an anchor.

Crocodile? Yes eating sand genius and super serious, much like Mizu Luffy man what compelling drama.

Enel? Bro airhead luffy, enel‚Äôs face, luffy being ping-pong‚Äôd off the stalk like three times? 

Gear 2 was made fun of for being ‚Äúhot pink Luffy‚Äù, 

and gear 3 is literally cartoon logic and little luffy afterwards reinforces the comedy.

Gecko Moria. The entire fight. Nightmare Luffy is scary looking and ‚Äúmonstrous‚Äù for sure, but its still ridiculous to look at.

They on some revisionist history if you think even GEAR FOURTH didnt get made fun of, Doffy LITERALLY makes fun of him in verse, tons of people thought bound man was silly.

For real, just comparing ONE OR TWO measly serious moments in the series does not negate the goofiness. The silly nature of the show is the ENTIRE REASON for this world. 

Oda‚Äôs world building is so phenomenal bc he created a world that justifies his craziest and wildest imaginations as an illustrator/mangaka.

The best and worst parts of One Piece are due to the goofiness and humor, and genuinely if you do not like some parts silly and goofy, OP isnt for you, because even the two ‚Äúmost serious‚Äù strawhats are goofballs.

Robin has gotten more laughs out of me than the majority of side characters, and even if she isn‚Äôt directly being humorous, she is played in a humorous light.

Zoro is an idiot and im so tired of Zoro fans thinking Zoro is the only one who isnt goofy. Bro is almost as goofy as Luffy bc of how hard headed and set in his ways he is. 

Not to mention scenes like him meeting Camie and erasing the mental image of granny Kokoro, or his constant inability to get from point a to b. (Literally gets lost going straight man what a no-nonsense character).",1883

Is it the fate of every captain, by virtue of being the strongest of their crew, to run into something that will cause them great illness?

Or is it the price for getting somewhere, and failing to do something?

Will we see people like Teach get there, fail, get sick?

Will Luffy be the first one not to fail?

I'm imagining some kind of conundrum for whoever gets to One Piece first. The last obstacle might be: ""Give up your life now and find the ultimate treasure; or give up here and forfeit your life slowly.""

It would be a final test of sorts. Only the bravest will get what's there.

Maybe Roger turned back. Got sick. Died.

Whitebeard wasn't interested, but may have gotten too close (to save an eager crewmate?) and got sick because of it.

I can see someone like Luffy looking at the text on the door quizzically, and just walking right in to the shock of everybody around him. The door closes. Everyone thinks he died.

But it turns out that ""give up your life now"" pretty much means ""you can stop being a pirate."" And Luffy understood it.

And he's the first to actually find One Piece but to also take it.

...and then he'll put it down, whatever it is, because it's just a big treasure thing that he's not interested in. What it stands for is to be the motivation for many others who seek freedom to go out there and go on adventures.

He found the ultimate freedom, he gets to completely ignore the world's most valuable treasure. He is the King of Pirates.

And Marco will be there to watch it all unfold, remembering when he got greedy and so very close... when Whitebeard had to save him. Whitebeard gave Marco the Phoenix Devil Fruit to save his life.

He's a similar age to the likes of Moria,Croc and Mihawk. The difference though is Marco helped WB run his yonko empire. Marco has been at the top with the WB Pirates for years.

In comparison Mihawk is a wandering swordsman with no responsibilities.

In a way Marco is a bit like Luffy in a sense that they both have a lot of mileage on the clock. Luffy is only 19 but has the experiences of a 40+ pirate.

In the end Luffy will defeat Akainu and Blackbeard so the vengeance for the WB Pirates will be complete.

What I love about Marco is he's understated but he has the respect of multiple yonkos. He's humble, apologising to a 15 year doctor for getting his identity wrong, not been fussed that a man is shouting for a woman to rescue him.


Most of the other yonko commanders are huge,imposing,scary. Marco isn't.

Yeah it‚Äôs really that simple. They already knew they were going to lose the war. It was purely an ego driven escapade to ‚Äúprove a point.‚Äù Not my head cannon. Oda depicted several instances of WB having the opportunity to prevent all of that from exploding back on him. Remember Shanks trying to talk him into being rational? I do. 

Anyways stuff like this is why I love One Piece. It‚Äôs character complexity is sneakily good. I had to remind myself while writing this as much as I loved WB, he‚Äôs a pirate. All pirates in the series are selfish. They just have different desires and personalities that make us resonate with some more than others.

Kinda like How King/Queen/Jack were some of the most feared pirates in existence but because they lost to Luffy's alliance they got cleaned out by Greenbull and brought to jail like a bunch of scrubs despite being insanely high level Yonko Commanders.

I do want to mention Shanks real quick, both Marco and Shanks were on the come up together in rival pirate crews and now Shanks is at such an insane level he reached WB despite being a child when he fought against Roger. He even had the balls to try and recruit Marco, I know he said no twice but I wish he'd said yes. For Anyone, defeating Shanks would be a much harder feat than any other Yonko in my opinion.",813

Since the fucking Star Wars prequels, showrunners and execs have been foregoing practical effects, props, and even *sets* just because underpaying a massive team of animators is cheaper and more reliable. I'm stunned any time I see a practical effect from after 2007. And I'm sure they do touch up the scenes in editing afterward, because this thing does move like an animatronic - it's not believable as a living creature in this clip.

Luffy like to fool around. Make jokes act on instinct , adhd attention span. Luffy isnt your bff nor does he act like a overly optimistic empath.

Luffy acts ind√Æfferent, isnt trying to touch your heart. But he'll be the best friend you'll ever have, and he wil help you without permission.

This live action luffy, although i get why he acts this way, and he is a genuine great human being, i find he forgets how and who luffy is and acts only on the feeling luffy gives people and tries to act in a way to get the result of that feeling. But he acts in a real life human way the way someone in real life would try to act. not in the personality of who the real fictive luffy is. There is no cool, very intuitivly intelligent but stil dumb luffy in this actor, he's just cute/mignon

He is to lovey dovey and cute.

Luffy is not cute or gentle or soft and all accepting.

Luffy is reckles, acts first, speaks his unfiltered mind immeadietly, doesnt care what most think of him and isnt a peoplepleaser.

In al i seen of him, only his smile compares to luffy, and something about the way his eyes look at things, it just doesnt feel like luffy.

Not because of the casting, just straight up his character doesn‚Äôt work in live action. His personality is too goofy and cartoony, like say Spongebob or something. It just feels awkward and unnatural seeing a real person play something like that, makes it feel like Luffy has the mind of a 5 year old boy, asexual and socially inept. This stands out against Nami and Zoro, who feel like normal human beings. It‚Äôs like if they tried to make live action looney tunes but with a hyper-realistic rabbit for Bugs",552

15vagwa,Words shared between Eiichiro Oda and Netflix during production of the Live Action,2023-08-19 08:29:25,"> ""Live-action adaption isn't about replication. It's about expression.""

A *LOT* of fanboys of various media are going to vehemently disagree with this as I can't express how much of the negative discourse around live-action adaptations is entirely rooted in ""this isn't a 1:1 replication of the source material, and that means it's not only a betrayal to fans, but a crime against the medium!""

That said, whoever said that at Netflix is 100% correct. 

A thing a lot of bitter fanboys I've encountered (both personally and just reading their arguments in retrospect via browsing old forums/threads) don't seem to realize is that these works like One Piece, Dragon Ball, Marvel, DC, Sherlock Holmes, etc don't exist to be pseudo-documentaries showing the factual historical events of the worlds their characters inhabit - they exist as artistic expression from their creators.

The point of these works of fiction, as with all works of fiction & art, is to either explore a facet of the human condition typically with an underlying narrative message (hence why so many shonen anime are about overcoming your weakness, using your strength to help the weak instead of abuse them, etc), or to make the viewers explore their own emotions (to laugh at jokes, cry when the characters experience tragedy, get scared/angry when the villains are in control, get hyped when the heroes turn things around, etc.).

An adaptation should be judged, not based on how accurately it portrays the source material in another medium (ignoring difference in mediums), but how well it uses the assets the source material provides to convey, to some degree, what the source material seeks to convey.

EDIT: Think of it like this; imagine a One Piece novelization that's literally just a courtroom-style transcription of the manga. Or if the only official animated version was a motion comic. It'd be awful. Changes to the story & format have to happen to work in a new medium.",1955
15vagwa,Words shared between Eiichiro Oda and Netflix during production of the Live Action,2023-08-19 08:29:25,"I struggle to think how this live-action is going to appeal to the non-fans. People who dismissed One Piece due to its cartoonish art style aren't likely to watch it due to the show trying to keep some of those cartoonish things. 

I mean the fanbase itself is split on the whole thing so I can't really imagine this bringing in people that already don't love the series or are familiar with it.",395

Just needs to play a bit more intellectually slow from how the trailers go. I kinda get they can‚Äôt have a complete dumbass for the LA, but that‚Äôs how Luffy is. He‚Äôs dumb, ridiculous, and pulls it off.

If he doesn‚Äôt fight with Arlong‚Äôs teeth in his fists, that is gonna disrupt the character spirit in this first arc for me. Just me though. Could be too ridiculous for the audience Netflix is trying to get in, but if you don‚Äôt lay those bricks - how do we get to G5 one day?

Also Nami and Sanji seem pretty fitting. Credit where credit is due. They seem to play the role well, faithfully, and and accurate as a LA allows them to. 

Zoro (Mackenyu Arata) seems bored all the time. Almost embarrassed that he is here. That might work overall, Zoro is frequently embarrassed of Luffy‚Äôs behaviour, but he‚Äôs engaged with it. The Brazil launch of all of this, he just looked grumpy and like he could have done better. If that‚Äôs planned to be a gradual buildup from his reluctance to his complete devotion (Mihawk fight), it‚Äôs played well. But he really doesn‚Äôt seem like he wants to be there.

160ju6w,Oda has a personal den den mushi,2023-08-25 00:41:34,"Ok, so my first thought was basically ""Of course he does, obviously."" but then I took a look at the actual picture and my GODS does a Den Den Mushi look just all kinds of weird in real life... Hey, if anyone else here is a fan of 'This Bites', do you think I should send this to the Cross-Brain, or hav e you already done it?",325
15pudl4,Do you think this was done on purpose?,2023-08-13 09:25:14,Sure Oda is always working with things from the past and i think we have here the same case,91
15pudl4,Do you think this was done on purpose?,2023-08-13 09:25:14,"'Round here, everything's on purpose dawg.",42
15pudl4,Do you think this was done on purpose?,2023-08-13 09:25:14,This is ANIME ONLY .. that image in the cloud from 1072 didnt happen in the manga,81
15pudl4,Do you think this was done on purpose?,2023-08-13 09:25:14,"Yes, skypiea and wano are parallells. These frames aren't drawn/designed for show. It's one of those if you see it you see it. If you don't remember it from skypiea then it's just another normal scene for the viewer.",216
15pudl4,Do you think this was done on purpose?,2023-08-13 09:25:14,"Yeah was pre planned, like warlords, haki and nika",50
15pudl4,Do you think this was done on purpose?,2023-08-13 09:25:14,I think the ANIMATORS made a call back to that scene with this. This was not in the manga and oda probably had nothing to do with this anime only scene,151
15pudl4,Do you think this was done on purpose?,2023-08-13 09:25:14,"The Nika pose can be seen as a callback to the Skypiea pose, yes. It was a past event that Oda thought he could work with in the present.

I wouldn‚Äôt say that the Skypiea pose was in any way a foreshadowing of Nika, though. That would be post hoc justification.",261
15pudl4,Do you think this was done on purpose?,2023-08-13 09:25:14,"Do you mean, ""do you think Oda purposely foreshadowed this scene in 2023?"" If so, obviously not. I think a lot of people keep misunderstanding that Oda did not use all of Skypeia to foreshadow Luffy's Nika powers, but rather that he used Skypeia's already existing IP to help the Nika transformation make more sense in the context of the series - i.e., retconning (which seems to get a lot of shit from manga fans, as if editing isn't a vital process to any other art form?). If you believe this was conscientious foreshadowing, then you're also assuming a man to plan a live service manga series 20 years in advance as if that's even remotely possible.",653
15pudl4,Do you think this was done on purpose?,2023-08-13 09:25:14,"No

This was done completely by accident, and was no way intended in any capacity /s

What the fuck do you think?",113

15pudl4,Do you think this was done on purpose?,2023-08-13 09:25:14,"I assume you mean was the one from skypia done as for shadowing. Given how much foreshadowing Oda does, it would be hard to believe that wasn‚Äôt planned. Ever since the mention of Joyboy and Roger saying he was born too early to see him, I think it made it very apparent that Luffy was always meant to be him or do something to earn the title eventually",352
15pudl4,Do you think this was done on purpose?,2023-08-13 09:25:14,so i‚Äôm not the only one who thought of this scene:D,51
15pudl4,Do you think this was done on purpose?,2023-08-13 09:25:14,No. Just an honest mistake,26

Think it wasn‚Äôt done on purpose‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶",93
15pudl4,Do you think this was done on purpose?,2023-08-13 09:25:14,If you mean they found a way to pay homage to older episode in a newer one the yeah! If you mean that oda created joyboy that early than no,139
15pudl4,Do you think this was done on purpose?,2023-08-13 09:25:14,"Its not foreshadowing, but maybe it could be considered a call back. Not everything is foreshadowing.",101
15pudl4,Do you think this was done on purpose?,2023-08-13 09:25:14,"I don't thonk it was foreshadowed, BUT i do believe that it's a call back, i feel that this is how Oda (and, when they get energized, the people working on the anime too) works his magic sort to speak. Set up details so he can see if he can bring back those details or do something with them later on, not necessarily planned, but leaving crumbs of stuff he thinks might be useful in the future, and as he goes he gets a more clear idea of he wants to do and sees where it goes. I think that's the coolest way of storytelling imo, especially for something that is going to be running for a while.",596
15pudl4,Do you think this was done on purpose?,2023-08-13 09:25:14,"I don‚Äôt think its related but if it is, it‚Äôs definitely not a foreshadow. Oda probably just went like ‚Äú oh i can do that again‚Äù",127
15pudl4,Do you think this was done on purpose?,2023-08-13 09:25:14,no i think he accidentally drew those pictures in a fugue state,63

Totally removed hiyori/shogun bit. This could have been added before joyboy reveal or in the previous ep. Totally killed the built up mid reveal. 

I want to clarify the hiyori bit is important and just as it was in the manga. I just don't agree with building up the joyboy entry for ten minutes and giving blueballs to viewers by switching to hiyori scene.

I have zero gripes with looney animation, again very true to the source. Could have been better in some way? Sure, but not bad by any means. 

Trimmed down the intro footage of npc's and zunesha behind to show more of luffy.  
Luffys hand was eating like 10 15 sec? to build up tension? put more of his face and other key characters to give it better dynamic.  
Slowed down the cloud split cause the scene was truly epic.Stitched the joyboy entry scene as there were many distracting frames in between.  
Added luffy laugh when gorosei introduce nika.  
Did numerous edits in final fight scene.  
Stitched gear 5 initial scene with kaido fight scene.  
Extended gear5 luffy filiing up his hand with air in front of the moon. (Goosebumps) 
Slowed down the luffy bouncing off the dragon breathe scene.   
There were so many .5 sec scenes that were so epic for example luffys face when kaido gets hit. Extended them all and synced the audio.

But I know Hyori was cut, but even then, I think it's obvious one of the biggest problems in this anime is density. One Chapter is just too little for an episode, you do need two to fill 20 minutes, which is why this is closer to 10...well

The Tom&Jerry and Looney Tunes references (sounds and animations) in the entire fight are added so randomly in this episode like ‚Äúputting too many toppings on a pizza and creating a pizza that doesn‚Äôt taste good‚Äù

People at Toei don‚Äôt know how to direct and choreograph anything. Nothing flows. It‚Äôs like each person has something to work on without communication with each other and then one person just compiles them all together without a proper group discussion.

What the studio released had so many great shots and amazing, zany moments, but they were downplayed by the strange choices they had made. 

I get they wanted it to be high energy and wacky and exaggerated, but if you're exaggerating it so much that the character is spending most of their time stretched off of the screen with only floating eyeballs or a smile trailing behind them on camera, it's difficult to tell what's actually happening and that makes it hard to get hyped!

One Piece is too popular for it‚Äôs own good, it is sadly a smart financial decision to keep weekly episodes, save on production and stretch the runtime as long as possible. Most anime audiences will watch it anyway just like enough people will buy unambitious pokemon games.

I think this sub has a skewed view of what is objectively good because they read the manga weekly and watch the episodes weekly and that skews your perspective of pacing

When you get 20mins a week it feels like you aren't getting much but 20mins of anime content is a tiny amount

Reindeer Chopper will probably be cgi. He goes through some stuff they couldn't let a real animal do

Hybrid Chopper though theres a few options

Chopper‚Äôs definitely gonna be a very difficult challenge since he has multiple forms with different shapes and sizes.

If you remember, people were scared of Chopper in his flashback.

They could go the Pokemon Live Action route and CGI Chopper, but the main problem might be that Chopper doesn't get enough screen time since they probably don't want to waste most of the budget on CGI Chopper.

So rather they get more budget or use stand-ins (dressed-up child actors) so Chopper can still feel like a part of the crew and not only there for crucial moments or when the budget allows for him to be there.",586

Chopper is supposed to be human with his fruit, so I wouldn't find it too ridiculous to just have a kid play him in base form. Then just replace him with a  really bulky dude in big form.

I mean there is Merry's death, two times (once when they understand it won't be able to navigate once again, and the true one at the end), Luffy vs Usopp, first encounter with GM agents through Robin disparition, Franky Family vs Strawhats, flashback of Franky and Tom, introduction of best marine T bone, the mystery of the EL hole, first time we see a gate of the justice, Gear 2 and Gear 3 (first recurent transformations), Iconic SH walk before confronting Robin and CP9, Luffy declaring WAR to GM (the only one who ever did it), the eternal mistery of who is Sniperking, first time we see people eating a fruit and discovering its powers excluding Luffy, the destruction of one of the main GM places, revelation about Luffy's family, introduction of Revolutionary Army, bounties for every SH (except Usopp because it's Sniperking who replace him in EL), burth of Thousand Sunny,...
And I don't mention it conclude for good Skypiea arc with the resolution around Merry's mystery and the evaluation of Skypiea's gold

In comparison, even if Marineford is incredible, it has less iconic scenes, it's just the iconic scenes are more focused on Luffy and have an even much stronger impact, but we shouldn't underestimate how impactful EL saga is on the story, I think this is literally the arc that makes us understand what One Piece will be after East Blue (there is Alabasta but I feel the saga more like of an introduction of what GL will be more than creating our understanding of OP verse)",1614

Sure, both AP and EL had that same personal edge to them, but in both of those cases, it wasn't a sure thing; the crew were at massive disadvantages in both of those scenarios, and SW also had the caveat of being a much more potent, immediate threat, with each member of the crew being practically ragged and already having suffered a party wide loss, but the thing is even without resorting to hindsight, nothing about the Franky Family (nor even Hody's crew) gave off the impression that they were a challenge to the crew, in fact the only reason that, for me, the Franky Family Fracasse places higher than the bought against Hody's crew was that at this moment, even with Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, and Chopper being as pissed as they are, nothing that they've personally accomplished would lead me to believe that they could, at this stage, take on 50'000 opponents without any issue, but during Fishman Island, that was like shooting fish in a barrel.",1331

Anyways I read your Berserk comment, I thought about both series and honestly in some ways I think One Piece is more mature than Berserk. Hard to explain why and it's certainly not the art style but OP gets to you and the situations are way past good vs evil, it's never that simple. Certainly got a few good hits in the feels in a way not a lot of series do. But maybe following a series for that long does that.

Anyways do yourself a favor - if you'll watch the anime, skip the filler episodes. There's lists on the internet. They add nothing to the story and slow down the story. Besides you'll have 23 years of One Piece to catch up on. I remember the movies as quite fun though, i guess you could try the series by watching one of those with your son since they don't spoil much about the main story and you'll get a feel of the series without starting a kid's show (since that's what it starts like).

Either way good stuff, I might give the live action a try after reading all this positive stuff, though it does looks a bit cringey to me.",1224

We've watched the first two episodes of the live action. I'm really liking it, though I do have some nitpicks thus far. I feel as though they haven't really captured Luffy's chaotic energy. Other aspects of his personality are there, which is great, but I'd like to see more of him just casually creating a little havoc for everyone around him, including his crew by just being himself. 

&#x200B;

I also felt as though when it came to Zoro going all-in with Luffy in that conversation with Buggy's henchman that this loyalty and trust didn't feel earned. It felt like they were telling rather than showing and that whatever would have influenced Zoro to this degree wasn't shown on screen. And speaking of Zoro, when Luffy rescued him in that courtyard, it felt as though this act lacked stakes. I think this was handled in the anime better. Also, during that big fight with Morgan, it felt as though this was more of a Zoro fight and that Luffy was just getting in the way. Luffy is supposed to be the best fighter on the crew, and I did not think that the first two episodes demonstrated that at all. 

&#x200B;

Nami feels pretty spot-on thus far, so hopefully as I get into more episodes I see the characters growing into how I perceive them to be based on watching 1,000 episodes of the anime.

-luffy‚Äôs shenanigans are kept to minimum

-many fight scenes occur inside

-most outside fight scenes take advantage of their biggest sets.

-zoomed in camera so you don‚Äôt see much of the village(sometimes blurring the background like EP3)

They were able to do east blue story very well within budget but it makes you wonder how the hell they are gonna pull off Alabasta? Having a constant CG character(Chopper) around is gonna be budget nightmare, as well as all the actions since fights become more flashy.

165e6fw,ONE PIECE | Final Trailer | Netflix,2023-08-30 13:04:13,"I don't watch or read One-Piece, so I have a genuine questions for those who do.

What exactly is the plan here? It seems essentially impossible that Netflix will adapt the entirety of the still ongoing story or even a significant percentage of it. Their most successful productions top out at 6-7 seasons of like 12 hour-long episodes a piece. Some back-of-the envelope math tells me that this can cover maybe 25% of the total content of the anime, ignoring filler and presumably speeding up the pacing by excising re-caps. And that's the best-case scenario.

So is there a natural stopping point somewhere around that 15-25% complete mark that fans hope the show runs until? Are fans expecting significant departures from the source material that cause this to be a super-compressed version of the story that properly ends in that short time frame? Like will Netflix Luffy's journey end in 96 1hr episodes? Or is the hope truly that this will break the mold of Netflix productions and run for 250 episodes of accelerated plot, completing basically the entire One-Piece saga? I kind of don't understand how this can be anything other than ultimately a disappointment for fans of One-Piece when it inevitably ends without being able to resolve many many character arcs and stories.",1281

It's like they feel it somehow degrades the Anime or something, like if you don't watch Anime, you don't deserve to have a series like this?

It is very weird. It feels like a very gatekeeping thing? Not sure how to completely articulate it?

My hope is, if people do actually watch it, and don't like it? Which is fair, I am not saying you have to like it. But, please try and not be a giant dick head to the people that do like it.

Having One Piece become the first great LA, Manga/Anime thing, would be amazing. Out of all things, no one thought something like One Piece could do it?

It seems like they did it? But, we still need to watch it. But, I am a completely fine with changes to the story, personally think it would be boring, if it was one to one, which is impossible anyways.

As long as the heart of what makes One Piece great is still there? The themes, the sense of adventure, a big world, that is connected in so many ways? I am good. And, especially when Oda has his seal of approval on it.

Because while we love One Piece, no one can love it like Oda does. He wouldn't say it's good, when it's not.",1248

165e6fw,ONE PIECE | Final Trailer | Netflix,2023-08-30 13:04:13,"The set design and costumes I think are as good as it can be done in real life. Big props there.

What I'm not sold on yet, and won't be until I see the first episode, is the delivery of dialogue and the lines themselves to actually carry a good series. Lines in Manga/Anime doesn't translate to real life in the same way, and from what I've seen in the trailers it's pretty cringe, voices and tones for delivering certain lines are not great, there's not a single line of dialogue in the trailers that felt natural, except Gold Roger.

Casting seems okay, I actually like that they used new actors, but seems like some misses. I don't think Zoro's voice is deep enough, and the size difference between Sanji and Zoro are uncanny. Sanji also seems a little too serious compared to his character in the manga/anime. Of course I do know it's tough to have everything fit, but just my opinion!

I also think they colored the cinematography wrong. I think it should be more vibrant given the charm of the series itself, but they went for a flatter cinema colouring that I think doesn't fit.

I just took a random part from the trailer and just added some saturation and brightness, maybe subjective but I think it fits a show like this way better no?

She almost seems bored. I understand Nami is one of the less goofy characters in the series but she‚Äôs definitely more expressive than what I‚Äôm seeing in these trailers. I‚Äôve actually opened up a lot more to the idea that this show might actually be pretty good so I‚Äôm looking forward to it.",410
165e6fw,ONE PIECE | Final Trailer | Netflix,2023-08-30 13:04:13,"Oda has given his stamp of approval for this and worked towards changes in it. The trailers look solid and the cast picks are good too.

Its not gonna be a perfect translation. It SHOULDNT be a perfect translation. As long as it's fun and stick close to the themes of the manga, it should be good.

We don't need another Deathnote...",333
165e6fw,ONE PIECE | Final Trailer | Netflix,2023-08-30 13:04:13,"I‚Äôve seen the whole season already and it‚Äôs amazing. I teared up in the first episode and then several times throughout. There have been quite a few adjustments, even as I write this I realised some that I just forgot about because the show starts to become its own thing in a way. Can‚Äôt wait for 5 pm tonight when it‚Äôs finally officially released.

I don‚Äôt want to spoil anything and I also don‚Äôt want Netflix to sue me so I won‚Äôt go into any specifics.

I‚Äôm getting a tattoo of Luffy this Saturday as well :D",510
165e6fw,ONE PIECE | Final Trailer | Netflix,2023-08-30 13:04:13,I wasnt able to resist and pretty much saw a bunch of leaked videos . Even the opening theme was so good.

The communication around the project was perfectly done.",212
165e6fw,ONE PIECE | Final Trailer | Netflix,2023-08-30 13:04:13,"Are people watching the same trailer as I am? Why the fuck does luffy have to explain to his crew what one piece is? Why is nami not acting like nami? Why is luffy threatening people? Why is he sensing tension?

The characters we fell in love with are not in this live action remake. Not only that, the cast can‚Äôt fucking act.

Absolutely astonished that people thing this is good writing, casting and dialogue. This is not good, like at all.

This is not one piece",465
165e6fw,ONE PIECE | Final Trailer | Netflix,2023-08-30 13:04:13,The biggest things that ruin it are the dialogue/writing and how several characters are butchered.,98

165e6fw,ONE PIECE | Final Trailer | Netflix,2023-08-30 13:04:13,"One thing I've noticed is the trailers definitely have more of a ""generic action adventure"" vibe than the clips that they've released. 

Which is fine, that's part of the game. That's how you get new people interested. But it's made it hard for fans of the manga/anime to tell how well they've managed to hit the specific feel of One Piece. 

Based on the clips I think the trailers aren't doing the show justice that way. But not too much longer before we'll know for sure.

EDIT: Just saying I think the show's going to be better than even the trailers are making it look. How good that'll be, I don't know. We'll see.",620
165e6fw,ONE PIECE | Final Trailer | Netflix,2023-08-30 13:04:13,"My biggest worry about this is the dialogue. Hopefully it's not too Holywood-ized or Netflix-ized or zoomer-fied or whatever the proper term is lol. Other than that, everything else is flipping lookin good so far!",213

165e6fw,ONE PIECE | Final Trailer | Netflix,2023-08-30 13:04:13,"Of course I'm gonna watch it.

But this feels like a massive waste of resources to me. I would prefer all this time, energy, and budget to go to more anime movies that can expand on so many flashbacks. At this point you can take almost any character and build a dopey movie about their past without having that much impact on the main story.

Give me a 3 hour long special about stuff that happened during the time skip over this Netflix show. But oh well, Ill see you all in the discussion threads tomorrow.",508

Garp is chasing as soon as they leave the first island and they shortened it up so that nami and zorro both join luffy with the map after leaving morgans keep.  


also coby gets more confidence right at the end instead of luffy helping him he just invites him to join and coby declines.  


it seems like they will end the show with luffy up on the scaffolding with buggy in logtown   


this is gonna be a really fun 24 hours commin up.",577

Also Oda stated and we‚Äôve been told multiple times by the show runners and directors that nothing went past Oda‚Äôs permission he made sure that everything they did was to the highest standards and also made them reshoot entire scenes if he felt it didn‚Äôt align with his vision.

A good example is that apparently Zoro‚Äôs backstory was that the the child actors for Zora and Kuina wore Kendo masks when they were training however Oda told them to go back and redo the entire scene so that we can see their faces; small things like that add to the greater experience.",851

Also keep in mind that prior to Luffy wanting a rematch against Laboon, Crocus was periodically sedating the island whale to keep him from bashing his head into a continent of connected mountain chains, so it's likely that prior to the SH passing through, there was a 1 in 3 chance that anyone coming into the Grand Line actually saw Laboon before moving on (with one third not seeing Laboon, and the last third being eaten by Laboon and not progressing onwards after that).

Keep in mind as well, the Krieg Pirates made no mention of Laboon (and whilst yes the argument on Oda not creating him yet can be applied, considering that Brook was already a planned member of the crew since the early sketches that also included Sanji's original proposed name, I doubt that Laboon wasn't at least thought up by the time of the Baratie Arc), despite having entered the Grand Line themselves.

Though with that being said, there was a period of time, roughly 24-26ish years before Luffy began his adventure that people entering the Grand Line did come across Laboon, and I'm almost positive that Shanks and Buggy both, at least when re-entering Paradise after Roger's death, did encounter Laboon",1412

It's really difficult to tell what's going on, and they didn't even get the moon jump pose right, that was an important callback all the way to Skypiea. Like, how many of you actually spotted the part where Luffy's eyes pop out of his head and he reaches out to grab them and shove them back in.

Now he's still got the same abilities but for some reason he's stronger. There is no reason why. He's using the exact same techniques but for some reason he's OP now.

- My Hero Academia

Over the years I've even convinced hardcore fans of Naruto and even people who hated on OP for the silly design of characters to give the show a chance.

Everybody, including former haters, is on the same page with me. Dragonball has a worse and more inconsistent story than Bleach, which pales before Naruto, which in turn cannot be compared to One Piece in terms of writing.

Our conclusion is that people who hate on the show or the manga simply haven't read or watched it. They are put off by the amount of chapters/episodes and try to be contrarians.

DBZ never made me cry, even though I was a hardcore fan. Bleach never made me cry. Naruto made me tear up when he gets finally acknowledged by Konoha, after the Pain fight, and Kushina's death scene.

Motherfucking One Piece had me tearing up for Zoro's vow back in ep 24, fucking Pell (before they ruined his death); had me cry over a goddamn boat; had me cry over Robin's backstory and her ""I wanna live!!"" line; had me cry over Ace and tear up over White Beard; had me tear up for ""Raizo is safe"" and countless other moments.

15lhuub,Same thing will happen when One piece ends.,2023-08-08 13:12:25,Oda wanted a serious arc and Wano helped make that possible. The whole series has been a cartoon and silly. Gear 5 makes it possible to finish-off the Wano arc in the same silly way that has been present throughout the series. This is the next big step. Anyone that shits on Gear 5 or episode 1071 has no idea what OP stands for.,329

But I love what the animators did to make Gear 5 feel whimsical and jovial.  They totally referenced ""The Mask"" in how Gear 5 moves and changes Luffy.  Bringing in this old school cartoon element to represent that is FUCKING genius.  Oda and this director are fucking talented MOTHERFUCKERS.  Beautiful.",453

15lhuub,Same thing will happen when One piece ends.,2023-08-08 13:12:25,"Oda is the writer who writes to express and not to impress. He wrote everything because he wanted to. He knows if his fandom will not like something and still goes ahead and writes it because he wants to. Thats why he is the GOAT. If people have watched One Piece fully and understood Luffy and the show's unseriousness then they will appreciate the grandeur of this Looney Fest. I will definitely do that. Freedom doesnt just mean roaming the seas, it also means being unaffected and unbound by other's opinions. Oda has achieved that, so should we fans. Saying this, I dont care about the imbeciles on twitter drama anymore, when will ch.1090 spoilers come ? I will go crazy if I dont receive my weekly dose of it. Please someone tell me. üò≠",742
15lhuub,Same thing will happen when One piece ends.,2023-08-08 13:12:25,"The thing is; there will always be people who say the episode sucked. Someone will always find the animation to be ""too whacky"", ""goofy"", ""trash"", etc. 

There are people who skipped to this episode and didn't understand a single thing. Of course they're hating. But there are also people who've veen reading for 10 years and still hated it.

In the end, why should I care what they think? The general vibe in the community is that the episode was good. Was it the best ever? Who the fuck knows. For some, yes. For others, no. Either way there is no absolute authority that can objectively say 1070 and 1071 and the following episodes are the greatest. It's a subjective thing.

It's the same in EVERY anime. You'll find people defending Hunter x Hunter with their entire being, even tho it has flaws. There are people who swear that Bleach is the greatest manga of all time even tho it's not. There are people who tell everyone One Piece is the best story in all of manga/anime even if it is an entirely subjective opinion. Some things can be backed by numbers - sales, watchtime, views, clicks,... but in the end you cannot force someone to like something just because YOU like it.

Am I a fan of Dragon Ball? No, I think its boring. Do I think it's bad? Hell no. There's a reason it's this big and popular. Maybe it's not for me but I have friends who absolutely adore it. And the other way around exists as well. One of my friends tried watching One Piece and just couldn't get into it. He said it was too weird, long winded, the fights were'nt the way he liked and he wasn't a fan of the characters overall. So? Who am I to tell him he's wrong? He tried it and didn't like it. Thats FINE.


So, since this comment it already too damn long; Can't we just stop with BOTH sides of this debate? Calling it ""Mid Piece"" is just childish behaviour but attacking people for ""not understanding what gear5 actually means"" is just as annoying. So what if they don't get it? Clapping back at them on reddit of all places will do literally nothing to persuade them to rethink and ""understand"" because they don't want to do that in the first place.

Real talk, I think I liked G5 more in the anime. A big part has to be the goddamn sound effects. It's so Looney tones I love it. The manga also made it Lonneyesque, but it felt so much more brought to life in the anime with the music and sound effects going. The animation was a bit much at times. But so is the manga. So much happens sometimes in panels it's hard for me to follow, so it makes sense the anime has some of the same problems.


But despite all nitpicking. G5 has always been Luffy's strength, creativity and a willingness to not give up while smiling. G5 is just what Luffy has always had amped up to absurd degrees which I love.",760

The anime completely butchered the whole thing.
Gear 5 is clearly meant to emulate old cartoons, the manga has that in spades and it was a blast to read. The anime on the other hand is nearly incomprehensible half the time. Constant zoomed in shots, disorienting camera panning and slowing down the action by lingering on details are completely counter to the spirit of the old shows it's trying to emulate.

If Luffy can stretch his arms out for miles, before a ""gum gum pistol"" why not be able to stretch both the skin and muscle to become an absolute unit of a giant? 

The only ""unrealistic"" aspects of Luffy's abilities are when he's in cold environments, when rubber gets cold it doesn't expand or contract like it does in warmer weather, and it also has the potential to crack and split, yet Luffy isn't affected by the cold and can still stretch like he can in warmer environments. But as it is a fantasy, we can forgive the unscientific issues. 

If we really wanted to get pedantic, what about those that can transform into other things? The pain alone from transforming from a young child into a pink dragon would be enough to cause that person to pass out. Your bones and muscles twist, shorten, expand, shrink, and grow in such a short amount of time that it would cause severe pain and discomfort, not including suddenly growing scales out of your skin.

The straw straw fruit is not actually person + straw DNA = straw person. Its whatever that persons wish was that originally made it in the void century or whatever. So its our interpretation of the fruits that is wrong. The gum gum fruit being Nikas fruit in reality is just that Nika had wished for those powers and his imagination dictated what it did and that means the traits of Nika himself were encoded on the fruit. Its like designing a character in a game and then other people can pick your character and use it.  


So like whoever made the sand fruit just wished to be sand and anything weird with the sand fruit is whatever that persons perspective was.

Lucci sent information to Kizaru about what happened inside the dome  

Saturn asks Kizaru if he can enter the dome with his speed 
Kizaru: Yes, but the man protecting the dome outside is my friend  

Kizaru tells Saturn that if he attacks Sentomaru, Sentomaru will order all the sea beasts, seraphim, and pacifista to destroy their ships  

Saturn says they need to protect three things:  
1-Punk Records  
2-York  
3-Power plant that creates the mother flame  

-Stella says they can escape by using Vegaforce because it's already next to the Sunny  

-Stella is trying to break York's password

One Piece is different. This transformation does make Luffy stronger, but its focus is making Luffy free. It also retcons Luffy's fruit, contrasts in tone with One Piece latest fights, and is the culmination of One Piece coherent power system. Without watching the series only thing you see is goofy rubber boy being silly. Thing is this was never a brute force power up as pretty much every other shonen make us used to.

IT's about friendship.

I love how it works. Makes sense that is an amalgamation of all his gears combined. I just hate the explanation.

That his devil fruits is somehow a legendary df all along. What happened to ""depending on the user and how is used, devil fruit can give you the decisive edge in battle"" that crocodile said. Or the fact that chopper and luffy trained so hard to get theirs df to the peak of what a ""useless"" could achieve. What's the point if he had a super op one all along. Before awakening and haki was introduced (specifically kings haki), the power system felt more cerebral, ypu had to find a weakness to super op devil fruits, and fight were more than, i have more will/ki/chakra than you, etc. That's what made the power system unique and deferential from others.

15r2gea,Does Kaido have Gears like Luffy?,2023-08-14 18:17:46,My head cannon is that the color change depicts his levels of drunk and his skin/scales becoming flushed. The purple is when he went into blood lust. So drunk he just wants to fight anything.,191

15r2gea,Does Kaido have Gears like Luffy?,2023-08-14 18:17:46,Pure headcanon but I believe kaido can only enter his awakened hybrid form when he's drunk. Similar to how luffy needs to be in pure joy and have the right heart rhythm to enter gear 5.,185

15r2gea,Does Kaido have Gears like Luffy?,2023-08-14 18:17:46,Luffy is a unique case since he‚Äôs a human and Nika sort of is too. This means he can‚Äôt shift between forms like a typical zoan. So his forms are basically his gears and those gears are just steps between a regular human and Nika. Gear second showcases how rubber throughout his body can be utilized and we see the iconic steam. Gear third starts showing off more creativity and just how far he can manipulate his body. Gear fourth is the closest to Nika with both steam and the manipulation of rubber on full display. Gear fifth activates awakening and it‚Äôs now  fully Nika.,574

15r2gea,Does Kaido have Gears like Luffy?,2023-08-14 18:17:46,"Gears are not inherently in a Devil Fruit, it's part of Luffy's ingenuity when it comes to battle that allows him to create the Gears. In Kaido's case, he doesn't really have Gears, just mood swings that fluctuate his power. Luffy's Gears are him modifying his rubber body to fit the situation. If a person is as adaptable with their DF, they can do something similar. 

Chopper is the closest I can think of. Instead of ""Gears"" he just calls them ""Points"".",457
15r2gea,Does Kaido have Gears like Luffy?,2023-08-14 18:17:46,"First: Despite what others keep commenting Kaido has not been confirmed to have an awakened form or abilities yet

Second: Not quite, see Zoan abilities are much more alterable and free than many believe, with beings such as Chopper, Rob Lucci, Black Maria, and even Marco each having their own additional or unique form, however that can also mean that any user of a Zoan-Class Devil Fruit can attain them as well. In Kaido's case his Drunken-Style can trigger an effect of shifting into different variations of his forms with even various abilities such as calling his lighting down on command, enhaced speed and agility, or in the fourth image's case super enhanced strength and durability

Kaido hasn't actually awakened his power yet but has mastered it to gift himself additional forms against an opponent he takes seriously after lasting a while against him, most likely due to the strain it can actually pit on his powers and the hangover once he stops being drunk

TD;LR: Not gears, just creative ways to display different created forms from his Devil Fruit, sorry for the rambling and kudos if you read through the whole thing",1136

15r2gea,Does Kaido have Gears like Luffy?,2023-08-14 18:17:46,"I feel like Kaido's multiple transformations, especially into a *fucking flaming superdragon*, were pretty clear indicators that yes, the strongest man in the world did awaken his devil fruit, and had been switching in and out of different forms throughout his battle with Luffy. Especially considering that Kaido seems to know very well how awakenings work for both paramecias and zoans, in any case. And that a zoan awakening does not *need* the steamy scarf thing around someone's head, because we know that Chopper's monster point does not have it, and neither did the Impel Down guards. 

I don't know. Part of me feels like the awakened conversation surrounding Kaido is constantly a competition of seeing which readers of OP can do the most mental gymnastics. Kaido is about old enough to withdraw from an IRA account without tax penalties, and has been a Yonko for a while - do we really, in our hearts, believe that he did not awaken his devil fruit, but *fucking* Doflamingo did?

Gear 3: Kaido becomes more of the opposite, becoming more like a dragon with human features. Gear 4: Kaido embodies his fruits power and becomes a full dragon. As for the awakening, it could be his final form against Luffy, which makes sense. It's a culmination of all his techniques and abilities into one final stage.

A famous mythical being associated with the power of the rubber rubber fruit basically meant the rubber rubber fruit was forever changed into the Nika fruit, granting a rubber body like before, but allows the user to transform into Nika like a zoan when awakened. 

Hence it being easy for the WG to keep the truth from the public and let them think it's just a rubber paramythia, and why the Nika power is the only one to require awakening to achieve a full-zoan transformation, and why Nika is the only mythical zoan not based on real world mythology.",812

The Gears aren't an inherent property of Luffy's fruit (aside from 5, which is the awakening, which fruits you would never say have Gears have too), but simply names for specific applications of the fruit. So they aren't Gears unless Kaido decides to call them Gears.

Are they something similar? Who knows, probably depends on where you draw the definition, and what the internal mechanisms of it are. You could similarly ask whether Chopper's Points are Gears, or Enel's Amaru, or Robin's Demonio. Personally, I'm for now thinking of Kaido's as more similar to Lucci's Seimei Kikan Kami-e Bushin trick, which is not an inherent part of the fruit at all, but an outside technique that happens to interact with it.

\+Kaido's transformations are different than his regular forms after drinking alcohol. But that's just for him.

\+Black Maria drinks a special drug to transform herself into her centaur-like form. Which her normal usage of her DF wouldn't allow her to have.

\+Rob Lucci managed to create a new shape with his rokushiki.

\+Chopper is the one closest to Luffy in terms of transformations with his rumble balls. In fact he has more transformations than Luffy. And he hasn't reached awakening yet.

Other zoan users haven't demonstrated such feats so far, except transforming certain parts of their bodies. Or accesing the powers without transforming, like Kaido.

In short, zoan DF gives it's users 2 transformations and awakening. But mythical types are in a different league due to their normal transformation having special powers beyond the conventional ones provided. Still, if they want to have more transformations they need external aid. Mainly drugs.",1023

Kaido is surprised by Luffy because he has been manipulating his body like a paramecia (gears 1 thru 4), but unleashed a transformation in gear 5 that is a mythical zoan trait. 
The human human fruit model Nika (the gum gum fruit) is a paramythia / mythical zoan hybrid, the sun god fruit. This fruit was called the gum gum fruit by the government to hide its true nature as the sun god fruit. They were afraid of it and managed to control it or haven‚Äôt seen it for 800 years since the last user before luffy, Joyboy.

As we know at first zoans have three levels. a persons base, hybrid and full zoan body. Most can do these at will but oda had hinted a while back how if a human ate choppers fruit they basically become a super human with no off switch and can‚Äôt swim. So it may just be a a thing in which eating a zoan fruit that basically is your species just puts you always in hybrid form until an awakening that is meant to represent the panicle of that species. Gears are essential luffy forcing parts of hybrid body to the extremes which isn‚Äôt unheard or unique to luffy.

People who don‚Äôt eat a similar species to their-self have two points of life factor that they are mixing a zoans users of this type gears would just be the various version of their hybrid body as they are forcing unique effects on their body to gain new skills.  


a good example to use is gear 2 this form is luffy forcing his veins to use their rubber properties to the extreme making him faster, choppers arm point forces his reindeers body to take on human muscles that are being transformed to the extreme of what a human muscle can handle.

TL;DR the various hybrid forms, choppers points, partial transformations are all gears luffy just only was able to use extreme hybrid forms cause his base is already a type of hybrid mode.",1311

15r2gea,Does Kaido have Gears like Luffy?,2023-08-14 18:17:46,"Luffy I think just named the powers his fruit gives him his gears, and I personally choose to view it like this:

Gear 2 + 3 are part of the base rubber-man form. Manipulating mass, size, and heartbeat, not to the same extent, and much less taxing than gear 5. 
Gear 2 especially tips me off, because its directly caused by him manipulating his heartbeat, which isn't brought up again until gear 5. Not to mention, he hits a similar stance when entering into gear 5 the 2nd time in Wano. It could just be a visual similarity but you never know. 

Gear 4 is his man-beast form. Its a middle ground that fully defies the properties of rubber while still being grounded with notable physical weaknesses. He has his steam scarf, eye changes, and overall enhanced physical ability.

Gear 5, obviously, is the full zoan transformation. THE sun god Nika, with reality bending powers in full swing.",890

15klm1y,Is there a chance? Why?,2023-08-07 14:02:08,"**My thought on Luffy x Hancock**

Here is my full thought on Luffy x Hancock:  under the impression that Hancock is entitled to Luffy‚Äôs love because she helped him at Impel Down and Marineford and declared her love for him. Another justification for the ship is that since Oda is bad at writing romance, Luffy x Hancock would happen lazily & comically. Is Oda really bad at writing romance? Let's take a closer look at how Oda handled the love story of Sanji and Pudding.

**Sanji x Pudding**

Sanji and Pudding started as strangers forced into an arranged political marriage. But ultimately found love in their difficult circumstances. After losing his crew & getting bullied by his family, Sanji had nothing left. So he agreed to marry Pudding to save his friends and perhaps have one last chance for some happiness. In a powerful scene, Sanji opened up to Pudding by removing his mask, showing her his pain and disfigured face. Later we found out that Pudding was equally broken. She had a tyrannical mother who undervalued her and suffered from low self-esteem. Sanji‚Äôs sacrifice left an impression on Pudding, who became emotionally conflicted. I believe she meant every word when she said ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt let our marriage be hell to you!!!‚Äù

Later, Sanji‚Äôs heart shattered upon learning of Pudding‚Äôs betrayal. For the first time in a long time, Sanji had to face the fact that he was all alone  ‚Äì he had no crew, no family, and no chance at happiness. He broke down. Pudding, however, remained emotionally conflicted. So, she needed a reason to kill the man who had sacrificed everything for his friends and done nothing to her. So, she showed Sanji her 3rd eye, hoping he would react with disgust. Instead, Sanji complimented her. Sanji‚Äôs kindness broke down Pudding‚Äôs emotional walls, softened heart, & put her on a redemptive path. Later, Sanji and Pudding worked as pretend husband and wife towards a common goal. Their development together culminated in a kiss, which effectively sealed the marriage and Pudding‚Äôs sacrifice. Just as Sanji was willing to sacrifice his happiness for the crew he loved, Pudding sacrificed her happiness for the man she loved.

Luffy x Pudding is a great example of proper emotional development, which debunks the thesis that Oda is bad at writing romance. Oda is a great romance writer because he understands that proper emotional development is the secret sauce to developing a profound friendship among a group of people (The Straw Hat Crew) and a great love story (Sanji x Pudding; Senior Pink x Russian; Oden x Toki).

**The Problem With LuHan**

Now, turning our attention to LuHan, we must address the lack of emotional depth between these characters. While Sanji x Pudding thrived on heartwarming connections, LuHan seems to lack that ""secret sauce"" that elevates a relationship to something special. Seeing how many LuHan shippers are hoping Hancock would join the crew, and get captured so Luffy can rush to her rescue, I think they are aware of this missing ingredient.

Considering Oda's approach to storytelling, which focuses on human relationships and emotions over power-scaling (unlike Dragon Ball), we can hold hope that any potential end-of-story pairing for Luffy won't be a mere Chichi x Goku imitation. For Luffy x Hancock to become a truly viable ship, their relationship must evolve beyond being a running gag that loses its charm with each mention.

Maybe there is still time to create that secret sauce. That's not entirely outside of the realms of possibility. Which begs the question: When exactly are we getting this fantastic and emotional Luffy x Hancock arc/subplot? Do LuHan shippers honestly believe that Oda will make Hancock‚Äôs feelings for Luffy the emotional linchpin of the final arc at this point in the story?

I don't see it happening, especially given Luffy's reaction when he found out that the Warlord System had been dissolved. He was more concerned about helping Vivi and inquiring about Hancock's well-being.",3990

15klm1y,Is there a chance? Why?,2023-08-07 14:02:08,"Im reposting this hear simply because I just answered this somewhere else. But to answer your question NO.

Its pretty obvious that if Luffy is with anyone it will be Nami. Lets name all the very clear reasons why. Also a few why it won't be Boa.

1. Luffy and Nami have literally the same goal since childhood just expressed differently. Nami wants to see and travel the world to map it (just another way to say she desires freedom above all else.) Luffy wants to be the king of the pirates and travel the planet.
2. Nami and Luffy have inseparable ties to the sunny. The first thing being Nami's Mikan trees. We have already seen what Luffy will go through hes literally glued to it.
3. They are both close in age with relations in their up bringing. With Nami being orphaned like Luffy and raised by some rough people.
4. They are both from the east blue with ties to it. It only makes sense that they travel together because they will eventually settle back in the east blue. Which brings me to a very valid observation. Which is that the Amazon Lily is not an easy place to end up in and its a long ass way from home.
5. Boa though being a perfect match seemingly is 12 years older. Not that it matters in OP but it also plays a large factor to her obligation as the empress. She's in a bit of a Vivi situation in which she needs to stay to protect her nation. She cant really afford to sail the seas freely like Nami or Luffy for too long.
6. Boa seems like a perfect match. Which is EXACTLY what Oda wants intentionally. By placing her in this position it makes it more of a jaw dropper to at least a fraction of the fanbase when he actually places Luffy with Nami. Boa being a perfect match kinda hints even more at them not being together.
7. Luffy said that NOBODY would be able to get with Nami basically because nobody is strong enough to handle her bs. She is perfectly aware of how difficult she is and is the type to take what she wants. Luffy wants to protect her at any cost while at the same time believing nobody is strong enough to handle her. He clearly believes he's the only one capable and he loves to do things the hard way so yea.
8. Nobody else has even remotely appeared as a candidate for Nami. So yea. We could go on and on. The giving her the hat. The mentioning of Garps punches hurting because they come from a place of love and we see Nami hurt him in the same way. Her though being the weakest literally navigating him to his dream. Him having no clue how to get around without her at all so even if they didn't end up together he'd still have to have her with him for the rest of his life basically. It goes on and on and on.

Luffy smashing laugh tale is a huge deal because it expresses his way of thinking. He will end up choosing to do things the same way he's always been doing them because he cares about the journey more than anything. If he doesn't become a sacrifice in the end and make us all sob like hell there are 3 ways it could go but lets be honest. Luffy and Nami are staying together even if they aren't official. Which is a huge thorn to Boas jealous nature. Boa might die to celestials protecting Luffy pissing everyone off because we know her distain for them.

Oh yea I almost forgot. Do you really think someone like Nami is going to let anyone aside from her have the details of the One Piece treasure. Of course she's going to map it out but not only that. She's not going to sit back and watch Luffy splurging with Boa. Remember that in Nami's eyes everyone on the ship is in debt to her when it comes to treasure. They are just borrowing it. My guess is that she wont confess until the end. Likely telling Luffy that he can pay her back by staying with her. We will never know if they become a couple end credits.",3776

Feel like if anything, Oda has set up that his endgame will either be Nobody, Nami, or possibly Uta (since she's canon now). Hell I'd say even Vivi has a higher shot than Hancock, he showed more concern for her than he did for Hancock when he learned the Warlord System got abolished. 

Edit: something I want to add too is the misbelief that marriage is incompatible with freedom. Freedom to choose is a type of freedom. 

To take a section from a mini essay: ""*Voluntarily* marrying or entering into a partnership with someone whom you share mutual love & respect with can be liberating. Good example would be Oden. He, similar to Luffy, was a carefree man. He hated the strict rules of Wano. He felt caged and cramped for not being able to leave. And yet he happily married Toki.

She did not restrict Oden's freedom. She supported his dream & encouraged his journey to Laughtale. Luffy rejected Hancock‚Äôs marriage proposal not because he was too dumb to understand marriage, or he was taking a stance against marriage as a freedom lover. He rejected her simply because he did not want to marry her.""

2nd Edit: No, Luffy is not asexual. Oda said he is interested in women's bodies, he just won't be a Perv about it unless Usopp is with him. (SBS 32 & 54). He's just prioritizing wanting to become Pirate King and achieving his true dream we still don't know about yet.

All told, she has more in common with Bartolomeo than she does with Luffy.  They, along with Coby, Rebecca, Leo, and Shirahoshi could absolutely form a ""Monkey D. Luffy"" Fanclub together.

The most important thing to consider, however, is that this is One Piece, and Oda doesn't exactly have a track record of feeding ships.  In fact, he tends to use them as a source of comedy, rather than drama - hence his portrayal of Hancock whenever Luffy is involved.  She basically turns from a hard and cynical woman who kicks baby animals into a simpering schoolgirl at the mere mention of his name, and that's the joke.  Fanon is fanon, and anything can happen there, but there is no chance of anything happening in canon.

What Sanji meant is when a woman (Robin) is ""forced to lie"", you as a man (Sanji) must understand her reasonings & circumstances instead of just be angry about it.

Basically means you must understand something instead of taking things at face value/surface level.

---

Edit :

I think the reason why Oda chose those words is to make the quote fits Sanji's character more, as in, to make the quote more personalized.

Because that quote integrates Sanji's womanizer trait & chivalry trait.

Basically Oda traded cooler/better words so the quote feels really like ""A Sanji quote"".",664

Also, I disagree with the sexist take. Sanji's bias towards women does not come from any form of misogyny, but from blind and over-the-top respect. Toxic? Yeah, but honestly the only people in his traumatic childhood who treated him nice were his mother and sister, no wonder why he respects women more than anything. He does not believe women are worthless or helpless, see how he called for Robin's help in Onigashima. He just has rock solid principles from his traumatic childhood.",710

15wg340,What this really means,2023-08-20 16:38:04,"NOTE: Minor Wano spoilers regarding Sanji & Robin in this comment. Not sure how to hide the specific line so I hope this note suffices.

My personal head cannon for why Sanji refuses to fight women is not that he thinks women are weak or not worth it fighting, not that he lusts after every woman he sees and so doesn‚Äôt hit them. I believe Sanji just detests fighting in general, and does so only out of necessity. He doesn‚Äôt think women are weak or need his protection, he called for Robin‚Äôs help without hesitation. Sanji doesn‚Äôt fight women because he hates violence. He couldn‚Äôt bear to hurt a woman, but he can bear hurting men. So I don‚Äôt think of Sanji as ‚Äúrefusing to fight women‚Äù I think of him as ‚Äúonly fighting men‚Äù. 

I‚Äôd also like to point out, a big reason I believe Sanji hates violence is because he behaves way differently in fights. When he‚Äôs not fighting he‚Äôs incredibly kind and respectful (usually). But once he‚Äôs in a fight he‚Äôs always angry and his voice takes on a bitter or spiteful tone.

This is also me doing my best to redeem Sanji and think of how he isn‚Äôt a sexist character. Although I realize sexism is a big flaw in his character, and I‚Äôm hoping that overcoming his sexist tropes will be a part of Sanji‚Äôs character arc in the end of the story. At the very least I‚Äôm confident Sanji will be forced to fight a woman at some point in the story.",1376

It is a so sexist sentence that start to become racist:

It means that males have always submit to women. Never fight back, never pretend to be on the same level, never pretend to receive respect.

This transmit an implicit sense that males are so superior to females, that they have to become their servants and slaves in way to balance the society.

Equity, friendship, fairness, respect and so on between genders are impossible if this philosophy is followed.

Males have to be always faithful knights of the females, while the females can be evil witches, and still not be punished or corrected, because they are weak.

Kuina's desperation was correct: in Onepiece females are seen always as inferior, also by the ""good guys"".

The only just person is Luffy: he punches who deserve it, including females (Alvida, Vivi, Boa's Sisters, Big Mom), and maybe also Usopp (Perona).",900

It's impossible that the straw hats run away from Kizaru or are defeated. It would just be like Sabaody and there's been too much buildup for that. Plus if they just run away, this wouldn't be the major incident that the narrator described it as.

I figure Luffy vs Kaido was an ""unfair"" 1-v-1 (Kaido was outnumbered, gave luffy multiple chances, was lifting an island, etc) so it makes sense for Luffy to get a ""fair"" 1-v-1 against an opponent that is at the same level as Kaido, even if he's perhaps a bit weaker.

Finally",27
163dljc,One Piece Chapter 1091 Spoilers,2023-08-28 05:48:28,"Textual summary by Redon

Colorspread in the cover: the Straw Hat crew is eating pizza. Sanji and Jinbe are cooking them, while Luffy, Nami, Zoro and Usopp are eating a big pizza with 2 elegant flamingos. Chopper and Brook are sitting in other table eating too (Robin and Franky don't appear).

Chapter starts with Pacifistas and Vegapunk's ""Sea Beast Weapon"" attacking Marines. ""Sea Beast Weapon"" sink some Marine battleships. Two Vice Admirals battle with them. Doll kicks one Pacifista in its face. The Vice Admiral with multiple chins uses a mechanical arm (like Zephyr in Film Z) to punch one of the ""Sea Beast Weapon"".

Cut to Kizaru Vs. Sentoumaru. Kizaru kicks Sentoumaru, his entire body flies away because of the attack.

Kizaru: ""Why are you siding with a pirate, Sentoumaru-kun?""

Sentoumaru: ""I will join with anyone to save Uncle Punk!!""

Sentoumaru's flashback starts, we can see Kizaru, Vegapunk and Sentoumaru first meeting. It's the same story that Oda explained in One Piece Volume 106 SBS. I will add that SBS question at the end of this summary for people that didn't read it\*.

Kizaru was the one who accompany Vegapunk to help the villagers from bears and they met Sentoumaru there. Vegapunk hired Sentoumaru as his bodyguard and Sentoumaru asked Kizaru to teach him how to fight to become a good bodyguard.

Back to the present. Kizaru uses ""Yasakani no Magatama"" to attack Sentoumaru. After that, Sentoumaru uses ""Ashigara Dokkoi‚ùû to attack Kizaru but Kizaru stops it without using his Logia fruit's power.

Kizaru: ""I thought you as good as I can, but my guard won't lose to yours!!""

After that Sentoumaru is defeated by Kizaru's beam. Then Kizaru uses the ""command chip"" to command Pacifistas and make them fight Vegapunk's ""Sea Beast Weapon"".

Kizaru: ""I just fulfill my mission, Sentoumaru-kun...

I wished I could have saved you along with York, ""Punk Records"" and ""Power Plant""...""

We can see a close up of Kizaru's face, he looks quite a bit more serious and angry than usual.

Cut to outside of the ""Labo Phase"", we can see that ""Vegaforce-01"" is carrying the Sunny to the other side of the island. At the same time, Kizaru flies through the barrier.

Inside the ""Labo Phase"", Lucci attacks Vegapunk but Stussy uses her body to protect him. Sanji takes the bubble gun from Nami and traps Kaku inside a bubble ball. Then Zoro attacks Lucci, both of them go through wall and flies outside the lab.

In the last page, we see that Kizaru is about to follow ""Vegaforce-01"" but Luffy appears and kicks Kizaru.

Luffy: ""Kizaru!! We are 100 times stronger than 2 years ago!!!""

PIRATEKING

End of chapter, break next week.

\*One Piece Volume 106 SBS question about Sentoumaru past, thanks to EtenBoby.

""Oda: Marines received a report saying that wild bears are attacking human villages on a certain island, and Vegapunk accompanied them to set up a system to fight bears. When the Marines were investigating the dangerous mountain, they came across a boy who defeated all the bears with sumo and reign as the boss of the mountain. And that boy was Sentoumaru. He was a boy who was abandoned by villagers due to his violent behaviors when he was younger. Intrigued by the strength of that boy who didn't return to the village and is always hungry, Vegapunk hired him as his bodyguard.",3313
163dljc,One Piece Chapter 1091 Spoilers,2023-08-28 05:48:28,Reading Sentoumaru got kicked away by Kizaru made me  envision a team rocket-esque send off and gave me a little chuckle.,121

163dljc,One Piece Chapter 1091 Spoilers,2023-08-28 05:48:28,"With Kizaru now fighting Luffy again after around 500 chapters, it raises an interesting question. When a Celestial Dragon orders an Admiral to attack someone, how long is the Admiral supposed to pursue that person or group if they are on the run before going back to whatever it is he was doing? 

Is there a time limit to how long an Admiral can pursue them, or is it until the Celestial Dragon gets bored and forgets about what happened?",440

If Kizaru wins the WG would obtain the Gomu Gomu no mi, no legend anymore, no hope for whomever trusted Luffy. Both Wano and Alabasta would be ""conquered"" by Marines obtaining informations and Pluton, Fishman island will be without protector and so on.   
If Luffy wins, would be a clear and univocal message, the Mugiwaras are the next candidate for Pirate King crew title, nothing can stop them if not a full war, with all the power involved, Luffy will reach Whitebeard lvl of respect and fear from Marines.

Did they not see the funny stupid eyes luffy made when Ace died or all those goofy scenes when he thought kuma killed them all in the sabaody. It's really just a goofy anime and anyone who thinks otherwise is an idiot who skipped 1000 episodes and just watched the latest fight. Like seriously do they all forget the goofy backstories of numerous characters like law and nami and oh how goofy it was when sanji's family was abusing him oh it was so goofy. And how can anybody forget the infamous scene of Robin where they all are laughing and she says this is so fun and i kinda want to be free. With those goofy eyes.

I like One Piece for everything it has to offer, and one of the best things One Piece has to offer are genuinely funny gags. But I also really liked the more ""serious"" elements, such as character writing and strong themes. Gear 5 is kind of weird. I don't have an issue with the style or powers of Gear 5. I have an issue with the way in which Gear 5 was attained. It's not just a devil fruit awakening which gives him new powers, but a mythical power which signifies that Luffy to be a mythical figure from the very beginning. Obviously Luffy has still worked very hard to get to where he is, but now we've been told that he was destined to work hard and save the world, because he is the chosen one. The value of hard work and freedom are two themes which have always been very prevalent in One Piece. It kinda calls the whole concept of freedom into question when you learn that the main character was destined to be a great hero no matter what. And it makes Luffy's tenacity and creativity seem more like an affect of his ""destiny"" too.",1086

I think as long as you are able to think and bring out will-power you can break out of any devil fruit. Being partially petrified should be manageable for Yamato i to stop the effect. 

HOWEVER we know in fact from the manga, getting completely transformed to stone you don‚Äôt remember what happened. It‚Äôs like no time has past. In the Manga when Boa temporarily transformed a higher ranked female guard from impel down. Therefore if somehow boa manage to transform the brain or the complete body it‚Äôs a win for boa. Therefore it‚Äôs not possible to break out if completely turn into stone imo. 

We have to consider Yamato thinks of herself as a men like Oden.  Oden was most likely straight. Therefore it‚Äôs possible Yamato could get petrified if she isn‚Äôt careful/mindful enough. Anyhow it‚Äôs a extremem difficult win for either side. 
My vote goes for Boa.",921

15w4sh4,Who wins in an all out battle.,2023-08-20 07:32:10,"We've seen Haki overcome DF once with Law and now everyone says it's easy peasy and thinking others like Yamato can do it.



We saw Law do it, a man who has a doctor/surgeon DF, vast knowledge of all things medical, and was using Haki to counteract a sickness based DF attack. Let's not just pretend that it means anyone is capable of it, for all we know Law might just have stronger haki than say, Luffy, just without Conq and with a ""worse"" DF.


Law was able to shambles on Doflamingo to move him into Luffy's attack, and Doffy has Coq, so it's not a ""Coq user auto win"" situation.",585
15w4sh4,Who wins in an all out battle.,2023-08-20 07:32:10,"You haven't seen this matchup posted before? Yeah right lol.

Anyways, it's hard to say. People really put a lot of stock in her clashing with her father,  and considering the 9 scabbards and Luffy, I'd say it is quite a feat regardless. Having a father like Kaido abusively grooming you to be his successor, a mythical zoan df, etc are all indicators she's top tier.

Hancock's strength is more unknown. There are a few things to go off though. Usually when Oda keeps a characters strength hidden this long, it's because they're quite strong and he isn't ready to use them yet. BB off-screening her isn't an anti-feat because he's never lost and his power is unknown in terms of we haven't seen anyone truly push him yet. Hancock's fruit is also tricky because Momonga avoided it by stabbing his hand, yet Devon and Vasco  got petrified. It's like her fruit is a coc blast above a regular one and if you don't really focus, she'll get you. In theory, what Law showed us at Winner isle with haki should work with petrification right? I assume that's how Doffy escaped Aokiji's ice...but nobody has escaped stone yet, which could be a testament to her power.

The final thing is bounty. I've said before that they aren't power levels, they're threat levels based on power, influence, resources. Hancock is the Empress of a nation of all female warriors, one of the longest reigning Shichibukai. We know on Amazon Lily, even low level crewmates can use basic armament on their arrows. We don't know how much influence she has outside of her country, but we know her beauty charms people easily, whether that's part of her fruit or not. She still has a bounty higher than King or Katakuri, despite them commanding Yonko crews, having the respect of their Captains, and thus probably authority over most of their allies. So her power (esp with fruit scaling to beauty) is def a major factor. Yamato is def in line with the All-Stars though, if not superior to some or all.

I think it's a close fight. They're within the same realm of power. I could totally see Yamato losing over the gag of being Oden, and Oden being pervy enough to be susceptible to Hancock. My only issue is, Oda is weird with female fighters. Cuz Yamato can transform, it's easier for her; but Hancock is the most feminine, and he doesn't like to draw males beating on feminine characters on screen very much. So I don't know if we'll ever see Hancock get a proper fight to show her power. If I had to pick though, I'd say Hancock by a narrow margin, but right now it's really a coin flip.",2557
15w4sh4,Who wins in an all out battle.,2023-08-20 07:32:10,"The limits of Boa's powers haven't really been established yet, nobody resisted being petrified by a hit.  
This puts her ahead, especially if Yamato doesn't know of her powers.  
Yamato also fights like Luffy, so not using full power at first which is fatal against Boa.

The good thing for Yamato is that only direct hits would petrify, so if the first hit isn't fatal, Yamato might turn it around.",400

The thing is, we Saw way more about Yamato than boa, boa Lost to bb yes, but it was in the middle of a battle, in which she slaughtered 2 World commanders and some vice admiral, so we dont know what happened.
On the other hand, Yamato is one of the only non yonko/pk characters who was able to clash, hurt and handle a yonko 1v1 (kid, Law, Luffy and akainu being the other ones), she has all types of advanced Haki.
So if boa is stronger than Yamato, it means she is also stronger than current zoro and Sanji, which is also possible, but honestly no one could mesure her limite since her clash with bb was not an 1v1",754

Hancock could have the ability to coat her attacks with conqueror's haki like Yamato, since her sister can use armament flow.

But simply looking that her performance against Blackbeard against Yamato against Kaido, it's easy to give the edge to Oni Princess. Though Blackbeard did use a sneak attack on her and we don't know how the fight would've developed if Rayleigh didn't show up.

Haki can override Devil Fruit abilities. So it's possible that Yamato'e haki is strong enough for them to be able to resist petrification.

So Yamato takes the win until we see more of Hancock's fighting abilities. Their haki is likely strong enough to resist petrification, and we've seen them be able to hold off hybrid Kaido.",736

15w4sh4,Who wins in an all out battle.,2023-08-20 07:32:10,"I'd put my vote on Boa here. We've seen Yamato bathe with men no problem, but we've never seen him with women so there's an argument to be made there if she can get attracted to women. 

Attraction aside, we already know that Boa's perfume femur can petrify even inanimate objects which have no emotions so her trigger for any move other than mero mero mero isn't fully up to emotions.

Seeing that she leads an island of female warriors known for their Haki and she herself being a confirmed COC user for a while now, it's safe to say she has mastery of atleast 2. So in terms of Haki vs Haki, they're pretty much equal or Hancock may even have the upper hand but let's just say they're equal for now, then it all boils down to hax, all attacks of Hancock have a petrification effect and she also has range advantage.

Speed-wise in showing, of course Yamato has it. The only problem is Big mom and Kaido was pretty much equal in that department when they clashed, then Kid who is not known for speed was tagging Big mom here and there. I tried to argue before that Kid must be just that fast as well, but the majority didn't agree with me. So I came to the conclusion that Speed at top tiers is pretty much insignificant since slower characters have been seen tagging much faster characters.

BUT until we actually see Hancock have a full on fight against top Tier, all these are just Guesses.",1395

Celestial dragon slave that rose to rulership after obtaining freedom, has all forms of haki and a powerful paramecia fruit.

People wank Hancock because she is still fairly mysterious and technically defeated most of the Blackbeard pirates via her fruit, but stat wise I doubt she‚Äôs in the upper echelons. I do believe that Doffy and Boa are both around mid commander level, but Yamato is far beyond that.

Else, it's probably gonna be Yamato since Boa relies a lot on it, we don't really know any major Haki feats from her apart from her having conquerors which Yamato had at age 8. And in all likelihood Yamato is physically stronger, faster and has more endurance, due to race, devil fruit and because she is used to duke it out with a yonko crew and her dad.

I imagine Boa is also an extremely strong fighter, after all she survived the summit war completely unscathed and we saw how she dominated everyone she fought. But I also see her as not getting involved in major battles before and probably either relying on her DF powers or her subordinates during their raids. The toughest opponents I assume she had before becoming a warlord were marines up to vice admirals and maybe past supernovae level pirates.",891

Also, Koby remained standing as well. So there had to be a limit where her power becomes practically useless in a fight and it gets down to fighting skills.

That said, I think when such a limit comes where her opponent seriously doesn‚Äôt care or has a Haki that overrides any DF then in that case Yamato might actually beat her given that she literally clashed with Kaido and has known feats but Boa doesn‚Äôt so we don‚Äôt know if Boa would have been able to even hold against Kaido the way Yamato was doing.",928

Agreed, I would think it's pretty obvious that it takes more than just nearly dying, if it were that easy, DF users who know about awakening would just pay people to nearly kill them.

Plus, Luffy has been on the verge of death several times (impel down, Marineford), if that's all it took he would have awakened before the time skip (yes I'm assuming Oda planned awakening ahead).

Luffy has always had a strong mind, as while he may not have been smart, his will has always been  almost unshakeable (not including ace's death, and losing the crew to Kuma), plus after discovering ACOC for himself, his body has never been stronger.

Imo its true that it looks like he dies then awakens but i would say so its a poetic way for Goda to show  us how his power-up is a way to fuse willpower (haki) with the will of his own devil fruit and shows how his sheer willpower evolves himself  very deep and detailed explanation of this is happening throughout the series and its also a way i watch it through the lenses of Nietzschean  Camel ,Lion and Child i don't know if Oda is doing it intentionally or not but to me it looks like he is for sure portraiting Luffy as the real embodiment of a free spirit Overman that goes through this his whole life and always try to self overcome .

In fact, i would say Luffy is a child that has to go every time through a lot of pressure and carry the burdens of the world to his back Overcomes it while becoming a Lion and then he goes back to be a child gear 5 is somehow a fusion of all those instantaneously its so deep if one thinks of it every single human being needs to do a bit of what Luffy does even if its not physical fights per se.

15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,"It's mostly because people attribute his resurrection ‚Äî with his heart stopping and then restarting with the beat of the drums of liberation ‚Äî as a necessary thing to awaken the devil fruit. Which might be true just as much as it might not.

Considering how the devil fruit requires the user to embody the more abstract concepts of the fruits (most recently discovered to be related to dreams) in mind and body, we can interpret it in multiple ways, it could even be more than one of these. It's unlikely that we will get a straight answer anytime soon so any guess is welcome. But the way I see it, it should be one or more of these:

1) His mind caught up to his devil fruit at that moment. Dying for the liberation of people or at least being willing to die for the dreams of many could have been what awakened the fruit;


2) His body caught up to his devil fruit at that moment. His heart needs to beat like the drums of liberation and needs to be very used to being rubber. Luffy achieved the latter by training with his various Gears but the only way Luffy could achieve the former is to stop his heart, probably by hyper flexing some muscle to lock it into place but how and why would he do that purposefully if he didn't even know that was a thing? When Kaidou killed Luffy and stopped his heart, Luffy automatically managed to make it beat like it needed to due to his sharp instincts and fulfilled this last trigger-like condition;


3) Luffy's body just got desperate. It's more accurate to say that Luffy's subconscious and remaining brain function got desperate, but what might've happened is that Luffy subconsciously changed his form because that was a possible thing his body could do and he never figured out he could do because as he himself said in Punk Hazard to Momo: ""I don't know how to transform, I can't teach you how because I'm not a Zoan fruit user."" and him dying for a few moments with his will to fight was enough for him to figure out how to transform;


4) Luffy's brain damage allowed his mind to catch up to his body. He took so many powerful hits to the head that I'm sure that even a rubber brain in a rubber skull would get concussed.",2173

15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,"I see it more as he's been slowly awakening it over time with each gear. A gradual process not a sudden process. His previous gear sort of had the cloud sash, but gear 5 its fully there. If that can be used as an indicator of awakening than he partially awakened it before. A much looser but still possible example was his ability to generate fire attacks. So I think he was building to it but the close to dying was the final step. Not that whenever he died it would be awakened... if that was the case then any previous user (assuming there were previous users) in the 800 years would've awakened it whenever they died.

Nika is associated with having fun, freedom, joy etc... Part of the power up is being free to fight however you imagine. How does your mind and body 'catch up' to that power?

 Is it a really active imagination? does your body need to be free of any limitations to your ability to fight? Freeing your mind from burdens? 

Assuming these answers or something similar are correct, I think it's possible death was thing to provide it. Luffy already had a lot of creativity and a wild imagination. He trained for 2 years and trained more on wano, catching his body up to his powers. This might very lead to the 'partial awakening' I mentioned earlier. But he was under immense pressure to protect his crew and his friends. He could not lose, failing was not an option. That's a huge burden, losing the fight to kaido freed him from that impossible expectation in my opinion. similar to how katakuri had to be perfect fighter  for his family but was in a way relieved when he lost. So by dying, I think that caught him up to ""being free"" 

Additionally, zoans are said to have a will of their own. I'm not sure but I think I remember that the animal/beast guards in impel down are the result of failed zoan awakenings where the animal will **takes over** completely  the human will. To me that implies the two wills have to be balanced. Maybe 'Nika's spirit to take over luffy for the fruit to be awakened, but the only chance it got was when luffy died. Because, as evidenced by his insane haki, luffy has tremendous Will power, there was no way it could've taken over another way. 

Finally, luffy is happiest and freest when he is able to chase after what his dream. The first few episodes of series show that he believes you should go all in and being willing to *die* chasing after your dream. If you can't do that then you're not free. Luffy did that by losing to kaido and thus ""became free"" 

Edit: I also wanted to connect the D. members smiling and dying in this section but couldn't form a coherent point for including them, but I still wanted mention it because of the theme of death

Body: his body has to be strong enough to handle the power of gear 5, he was definitely not ready for it at any point pre-TS. He would've just died in Arabasta or impel down without other people's help. He probably didn't even come close to awakening it until WCI, after unlocking multiple new forms of gear 4 and future sight.

Just to add, Luffy fruit is a weird problem because he is a rubber man, but not because his fruit is a rubber fruit, but because his fruit is a god who pursuits freedom, and it reflects in his body by making him do whatever he wants with it. So his syncronization with mind and body is more complicated.

His body may have caught up but his awakening, his fruit, they revolve around a person being able to do what comes in their head with no limitations, literally to be free. Wano is the peak of this story and character theme prevalent throughout One Piece and Luffy‚Äôs travels. Alabasta was Luffy helping his friend Vivi and yes it was also because he hated how Alabasta was being treated under Croc. Dressrosa also had a lot of factors going into it, his alliance with Law being one of the major ones. Wano though, we have never seen Luffy‚Äôs desire to liberate more strong than we‚Äôve seen it in Wano. Nika is someone who gave freedom back to the people and the peak of this concept is what Luffy hit when he decided to go balls to the wall insane by fighting THE Kaido for strangers he‚Äôs never met, when he decided to carry a country on his back, when he decided to risk everything for the friends from Wano he made. I think even if his body caught up to it he wouldnt have awakened had he not chosen to liberate Wano. Doflamingo‚Äôs fruit is also about manipulation and he awakens it because he‚Äôs the most manipulative person we‚Äôve ever seen. Katakuri‚Äôs fruit is about adapting to become what you need; just how he adapted himself and his identity to become whatever his family needed, even if that wasnt himself. 

Its been stated these fruits have wills of their own. Theyre manifestations of the wish of a will from long ago. Why would they awaken to someone they dont agree with? Someone that doesnt embody the wish that gave them form? Why didnt anyone else ever awaken this fruit? Who better to awaken it than the man with the truest idea of freedom on the seas right now?",1732

I don‚Äôt think a near death experience is required to awaken a fruit I just think for luffy it was what gave him the final push.

If something remains outside the domain of understanding, then the application would automatically become impossible to comprehend.

A near death experience changes people in unfathomable ways and since Oda-San takes everything that the world has to offer into making One Piece, I couldn't help but IMAGINE it in this way that the mind (the belief) would certainly have that impact required to bring about the change in perspective that could lead to a massive boost to anyone.

In Luffy's case, he's a completely different person. White everything, extra funny and is enjoying a fatal battle like it is only the pure joy of experiencing the fight that matters to him and he has the ability to do what he wants to change the direction of the fight using his imagination and power while coming up with funny ways to fight doing funny things overall. It's safe to say that it is the embodiment of liberation. Liberation from the constraints that hold on the barriers of the mind.

Luffy has symbolized hope and freedom the whole manga but in this particular moment his whole character arc hit the point where he could awaken. It was the right opponent, right stakes, right time. Any death wasn't the key, he's been on the brink many times. Brushing with death pushes you to new heights, it's literally life or death. 

That's why Big Mom's soul pocus or whatever is so scary to most people. You really find out what a person is made of when she faces them with that choice, and Luffy went beyond that with Kaido.

15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,"It‚Äôs mostly because awakening is still a very mysterious thing in one piece

And looking at things as just a casual viewer it goes like this:

Luffy takes a fatal hit and dies but his devil fruit revives him and awakens

Hell I still think that luffy could have awakened at any point in the series since there hasn‚Äôt been anything directly stating that luffy dying at any point would not have caused him to awaken gear 5",420
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,"I agree. He awakened because he pushed himself further beyond his capabilities than he ever has, even going to the brink of death 3 times in a few hours. It was a case of the straw that broke the camel's back, not just a passive built in revive. It's like when Goku went UI Sign the first time. He died a few times before that, but this time he went so far beyond his mortal abilities he transcended them and his god training came full circle. It's a do or die (literally) awakening in both examples. I don't believe Luffy would have just randomly turned into Gear 5 in volume 1 if Shanks let the sea king eat him.",614
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,"My interpretation is that his death was the trigger for the awakening at that moment, he had already reached awakening and if he whouldent have died he whould have awakened anyways a bit later but his desperation at his death was what triggerd it.",247
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,"It's true that he wouldn't have awakened his powers simply by dying but it's a very widespread theory that ""dying"" was what let ""joy boy"" took control over Luffy's body to fasten the transformation",197
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,Its cuz people assumed that kaido killed luffy before he awakened and the devil fruit revived him. Its kinda supported by luffy getting up and saying what happened i thought i died. But i don't think its confirmed.,214
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,"I think awakening could have different requirements depending on your fruit.

Luffy has a key aspect of gear 5 in all of his other gears.

Gear 2 - Luffy manually pumps his blood. In gear 5 the drums are just his heartbeat doing it automatically.

Gear 3 - Luffy inflated his skeleton but is limited to maybe a few body parts. Gear 5 gives him greater control over his rubber inflation allowing him to become an actual giant. 

Gear 4 - Luffy inflated his muscles so he could force control over his rubber to do things like compress and change attack trajectory. Downside was he needed haki as a vice to control it. Gear 5 allows him to control the rubber muscles freely without the need for excess haki (muscle muscle muscle form) 

Gear 5 is quite literally the culmination of all his techniques + turning his environment into rubber + zoan awakening stamina. 

Luffy progressed a ton in his fight with Kaido making giant leaps in progress. He just happened to awaken at the right time. 

The requirements for other devil fruits might be easier or harder though depending. 

Luffy might be a special case as a mythical zoan which might be even more confusing. (Mythical zoan = zoan + (paramecia/logia/another zoan?))",1218
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,"Idk lol. Because your body and mind needs to catch up with each other. Luffy‚Äôs body must‚Äôve been there during Wano from the training (at least), but the final push was his mind catching up. In some sense, he needed to be near death or pretty much dead for his mind to catch up",276
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,"What Kaido explains here is fairly straight forward, eating a fruit makes X number of powers available to you, however you cannot unlock the final stage (awakening) until your mind and body is aligned and catches up with the fruit.

So no, had Luffy died at any other earlier point his fruit would not have awakened, him getting stronger in this fight gave him the nudge he needed to be able to awaken. 

In simple terms we can use a Gym analogy. The human body can deadlift 300lbs no problem, however to do that you need to train your mind and body to get to that point and be able to actually do it.",601
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,"Like Dragon Ball fans, One Piece fans can‚Äôt read.",49
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,"As you can see üëÄ, he couldn't",29
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,"It's whenever he died in Wano. Roger saw a prophecy on Fishman island that someone would be born in future who would surpass them, he also heard those sea kings saying the two kings(Joyboy and Poseidon) would be born soon , one on Fishman island and the other in the East(East Blue) and would meet and this time it will work whatever that is, and after Laugh Tale, Oden wrote in his journal that if he wasn't able to stop Kaido, 20 yrs to come, someone will come and defeat him. Kaido was told tales by King about Joyboy (King thought Kaido was Joyboy) and Joyboy's first appearance would be in Wano so am guessing that's why Kaido made Wano his base but am assuming if Luffy died at any point in the story,, due to all the prophecies said and info from Laugh Tale, he would have probably awakened coz the prophecies need to come true somehow and there's no one in this era who has Joyboy's will.",896
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,"The anime actually explained better: The condition for Gear 5 is Luffy's heartbeat matching Joyboy/Drums of liberation rhythm. When you have a cardiac arrest, your heart beats faster and in irregular rhythm( arrhythmia) until it stops, it just so happened that by almost dying Luffy by chance matched said heartbeat and awakened the ""Sun God Nikka"" contained inside his fruit. When his transformation ceases and he has to transform again in the last episode, he has to remember the heartbeat he assimilated in order to do it again.",531
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,"Its pretty clear that the reason he awakened is because he meshed emotionally with joyboy who is the soul do of the zoan. He obtained this by attempting to save wano. You could argue he has saved multiple islands before but saving the island was never before particularly his objective just a ""Yeah i guess your welcome but its not what i came here for just something i did while here you know"" Luffy went to wano specifically to liberate it thats what made him a viable candidate for joyboy.",492
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,"I don‚Äôt say that, but I can see someone saying ‚Äúdeath‚Äù or nearly dead as the epitome of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù from the world.  Thus mind and body catch up to your powers when your powers are freedom incarnate.  I still prefer how hard Luffy fights to be free eventually peaking as my own explanation.",288
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,then why didnt kaido awaken?,28
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,If Luffy would‚Äôve died earlier than he wouldn‚Äôt have awakened but I think he had to die in order to actually achieve it. Just a matter of WHEN he died. Luckily he died after his body caught up.,193
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,He had to die to get his heart pumping,38
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,"What kind of silly ass logic is that,First it's well established that haki and devil fruit are not related at all,""All this catching up"" logic only applies if haki and devil fruit are related but that is shown from start that your df ability and skill is independent of your haki,even if it were to be related then doffy and law should not have been able to get awakening,plus luffy didn't do anything specific to his devil fruit he only improved his haki,If fruit usage is the only parameter,buggy should have been king of pirates by now",538
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,Because Oda is his creator,26

15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,Because he's a Zoan. It was said in Impel Down that they got back up because they were awakened after being taken down by Luddy Croc and Jimbei.,144
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,Just nen gets stronger when you die,35
15u3nbg,Why do people say that luffy would have awakened whenever he died?,2023-08-17 23:36:41,"I think it means, 

Luffy already had the goat mentality, but he didn't have enough physical strength, but after training so much and pushing his body through its limit against a stronger opponent, he was finally able to awaken his devil fruit power.",250

15mi620,luffy has come such a long way,2023-08-09 15:15:57,Yeah I think from context clues: who‚Äôs who said the sun god Nika has the power to free the enslaved. And luffy was on the brink of death with that final blow from kaido so the fruit had no choice but to awaken and fulfill its role of  1. Protecting luffy (it‚Äôs user) since the fruit is a down and has a mind of its own in a sense and 2. freeing everyone that would have been further enslaved had kaido won. The fruit is fulfilling one of its many purposes,455

Other pirates have been pirates for way longer.

Doflamingo turned stone into string
Katakuri turned mirror world walls (whatever those are made of) into mochi
Doflamingo turned string into a clone, a talking self-functioning clone
Law grew his sword to be a mile long

Like the whole thing behind devil fruits is that they warp reality, so to boil luffy's power now down to ""he can warp reality"" is just stating the literal obvious. The majority of what he did still fully revolved around rubber.

Turning the ground into rubber to repel blast breath
Expanding his rubber body to be giant
He created goggles using rubber (SWIM GOGGLES ARE LITERALLY MADE OF RUBBER INCLUDING THE LENSES)

He literally just has more freedom to affect himself and turn things around him to rubber. Which again does warp reality, but isn't anything new from other devil fruits.",1003

Like how he grabbed lightning, he turned it into rubber and grabbed it and when he released it he turn in back into a regular bolt of lightning. Or when he expanded himself like how he expanded his arm in gear 3 but with his entire body without needing to blow his whole body up like a balloon. I think Oda took some liberties to make the battle more cartoonish and entertaining but I still his awakening with G5 boils down to being able to turn objects into rubber and alter them.

In One Piece we've seen the weirdest shit ever, and Oda himself said in an interview (and Vegapunk in the manga) that fruits come from desire: desire to have a thousand hands to draw more in less time, to stretch arms to grab the remote waiting for you on the table, to become an animal, to fly, name it.

How I like to think about it:  
It is that just like he is not unlimited in his movement but his devilfruit allows him to stretch and move more freely than a normal human, his awakening allows him to stretch logic a bit into the cartoonish. I would argue that stretching logic into the cartoonish was already a big part of his gears. G2 the least with there being some explanation in him pumping his blood faster to increase his metabolism but his body literally steaming and, well, everything else is certainly a stretch of logic. G3 being really heavy even though it's just filled with air is already pure cartoon logic we accepted into the world of One Piece, but just around Luffy because Usopps Hammer does not work along that logic, and G4 blowing up his muscles to get stronger is cartoon logic that could be straight out of popeye.

It is clear in anime and manga that his powers make the fight work with a different logic than other fights, one way more advantageous to luffy. One where he is as free as possible. It wouldn't be a reach to just assume that stretching logic would be something the awakening of a fruit like this would do.",1378

And the tire screeching sound is his incredible vocal talent?

And the goggles he creates from his hair on Egghead, as others have mentioned -- he's just so attuned to rubber he can turn parts of his body into *clearly not rubber*? Or does it just look like goggles, but actually even the shine is just rubber, and he's blinding himself by putting them on?

It's toon force. He has toon powers. I don't know why this is so controversial.

His rubber powers were *already* crossing many thresholds of ""that doesn't make *any* sense even in this heightened fictitious world"" when Gear 3 shows up. Then Gear 4 comes along and goes ""actually air in his *muscles* is even more powerful"" as if that makes sense, and then doubles down and goes ""also he can just sort of bounce his attacks on nothing to change their direction (not awakened tho)"" and that's that?

Sure, Awakenings affect the user's surroundings, but we've seen multiple instances now of pure energy (The lightning Bolt & Kaido's Blast Breath) being given elastic properties as well as >!forcing that elasticity onto another person entirely (Kaido's insides) !<whereas no other Awakening has been shown to affect anything to that degree before (Doflamingo turned surrounding landscape to Strings for him to manipulate & Katakuri turned the same to Mochi, >!but neither could literally turn another oerson into said material. The closest we've got is Kidd who could Magnetize a living being, but that's not the same as turning them into Metal themselves.!<

15nivq0,How some fans read Gear 5th,2023-08-10 17:35:23,"Tbh I always interpreted G5 as a big stat boost + a new toolbox for Luffy to make a plethora of new moves. The toolbox aspect is very powerful and operates on some toon logic, but it isn‚Äôt like Bugs Bunny or Popeye stuff. Gear 5 was still being hurt by Kaido and he couldn‚Äôt just will all damage away. Luffy can use his awakening to affect things, such as grabbing the lightning bolt since it couldn‚Äôt hurt him anyway and altering his body to an extreme degree, but I do not think he‚Äôs able to just warp everything to how he pleases at will. We have seen G5 hurt and pushed. He‚Äôs not invincible.

When Luffy says ‚ÄúI can do everything I ever wanted now!‚Äù and when the manga said ‚ÄúThe power to turn imagination to reality‚Äù, I believe it was moreso referencing that Luffy can really do all the moves he ever wanted with his fruit since his rubber is so much more versatile in G5. His body can twist, turn, and morph to any shape he pleases. Any goofy gomu move he has likely imagined doing in his head he can probably do now. He can affect things around him to a degree and overall just has more stuff he can do. He doesn‚Äôt have to follow as many rules, but there‚Äôs still some like his opponent‚Äôs own stats and power. We saw this with Kaido and we will likely see it again in the next big fight for G5.

From a narrative perspective, it just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me for G5 to be reality warping enough to solo his verse or beat the likes of Goku. Luffy still has challenges ahead. Now Gear 5 is def a huge power up and nothing to scoff at even by top tiers in OP, but it isn‚Äôt all powerful or omnipresent as of yet. It has limits and some rules, just less of them compared to anything Luffy had before. He‚Äôs more free.",1716

Luffys fruit makes things goofy and makes him more free to do what he wants with hia rubber powers, but its not toon force, luffy will never jump to the previous page of the manga and say do over, or ask oda to draw an enemy in a silly fashion or hell, even do it himself.

The general implication is that his power goes beyond the normal sense of what an awakening should do.

He can even make immaterial things like lightning and fire and generally behave far more... ""conceptually"" like rubber.

Isn't it always paramecia users? If that IS the case (again, unsure about this) it's kinda crazy. That would mean that the fruit's power of fighting with his imagination would mean, he couldn't make his surroundings rubber. However, Luffy doesn't know he's a Zoan. He thinks he's a paramecia and in his imagination he's just doing what he thinks a paramecia awakening does. Which if that's the case is kinda nuts.",525

15nivq0,How some fans read Gear 5th,2023-08-10 17:35:23,"The thing is, to say we actually *laugh* during G5 is a stretch. It's not very funny, not over the natural comedic scenes during battle like shark teeth Luffy, Water Luffy, octopus Luffy, wax Luffy and tank man. These were all funny yet reasonable as creative ways for Luffy to overcome his enemy. 

G5 is just forced tbh. I like the concept of it, but how Oda executes that is questionable. Gomu Gomu was iconic because it's a very non-traditional and seemingly low tier ability, yet Luffy made do with it to where he is now. Giving him a winner power just like Naruto or Ichigo ruins that premises for a lot of us. Also the forced comedic scenes, especially eyes popping out everywhere even for Kid and Law who just look bad with it. 

And well, Luffy was competing well with Kaido with just gear 4 unlike the time vs Lucci or Doffy where he cannot even fight back without new gear kinda take away for need to power up another time.",934
15nivq0,How some fans read Gear 5th,2023-08-10 17:35:23,Literally the first thing he did was pick up a piece of the ground and turn it rubber and people still acting like G5 isn't him stretching reality lol,150

Just my opinion, i think Nami is the opposite of a barbie girl or curvy girl or the stereotype of the sexy girl all together if you like. The less barbie you look the better fit to nami cosplay. In short, dont try to be too sexy when you cosplay characters like nami who look way more basic, looks off.  But if this is only  for the ""outfit"", its cool.

Just an opinion dont take it too seriously",409

Yeah I'm sure it probably also doesn't mean anything that his manga is about a bunch of outcasts going at war against a rich imperialist leader cast, freeing people from dictatorship and fascists, and that the only legitimately morally good group in the manga is the revolutionaries, and that the protagonist and his cook wants ANYONE to have the rights to eat.

Che for Americans side of the story is that he was a terrorist for un-aliving a lot of people, gays and saying racist remarks and enjoying un-aliving in general. He was also a communist and threatened to do Terrorism in USA. 

If you talk to latinos, specially Cubans and Argentinos  the story is that he was a revolutionary and while he did in fact bad things ( a lot was harmful propaganda) he was a champion to the poor and he helped expel Batista which was another dictator enriching  himself from the average citizen (Batista had overthrown the previous governor and was pro USA interest)

Che was an expert in guerrilla warfare and helped Fidel win the battle of pigs which was an failed coup on Cuba by the CIA(CPO) and ex Cubans. Che and Fidel managed to free Cuba from the imperialist USA (but ended up embargoed due to nationalizing their own oil, sugar and other resources. Basically a trade war.) He also was also not the cold blooded killer and gay hater that the usa had painted him. 

He tried to start revolution in Venezuela, Congo and Bolivia (previous countries damaged by colonialism and imperialism) He ultimately failed and was una lived by the Bolivian soldiers directed by the CP0.

His last words were: I know you've come to kill me, Shoot, you are only going to kill a man.

This sounds like a whole arch in OP if you ask me.

Jinbei vs Vasco

Both are the heaviest drinkers of their respective crews based on sbs. Shot looks like a Fishman too. Both manipulate water. There is no pattern to predict bc Jinbei has only had one fight so far. I would guess he fights people he despises as who and shot seem to be the worst of their crew

Franky vs Burgess 

Franky's previous matchups have all been against macho wrestlers(senior pink, cp9 guy, sasaki). Franky was present where Burgess fought Sabo. Franky's most used non ranged moves are strong right/left, suplex, and Franky boxing. And he's a cyborg like Franky

Robin vs Wolf

San Juan Wolf sounds similar to Tequila Wolf and its purpose has never been revealed with Robin being there for two years. His title only refers to size with him not having anything to do with a ship. Robin is influenced by giants and has a giant form as of Wano. Laffitte is too small to fight her.

Brook vs Laffitte

Both hypnotist, skinny. Brook uses music to spread joy like when he went into the joyboy pose on Fishman island. Laffitte uses it for his own gains. Also sirens sing music and it is likely that is his fruit.",1255

Zoro vs Shiryu, not only because swords, but because we saw Zoro win fights with two types of Haki, conqueror and armament, the next logical place he can go is like Luffy, being thrown in a fight that will force him to rely on observation Haki, even awaken futur sight, hence, fighting an invisible force is perfect for it.



Sanji vs Vasco Shot, he's strong , Oda likes putting Sanji vs goofy characters when it's not womens, and we have two opposite in terms of characters, one is chivalrous, the other likely a murderous rapist.



Jinbe vs Burgess, both strong helmsmen, Burgess seems to rely a lot on his strength gained by his fruit, pitting him against someone who don't fight with a fruit and still a strong physical fighter seems probable.



Robin vs Kuzan, yes , i still think this will happen given the history they share together, be it a false fight with Kuzan forfeiting when judging Robin became strong and in a good place, or serious fight with a clash of values, this will be good for Robin's character arc.


Yamato vs Devon : yup, still thinks she will be aboard the Sunny by the times we get to Blackbeard, not gonna give up hope. Two mythical dogs fruits user, someone who spent most of her life trying to be another person versus the woman that actually have the power to become anyone.



Other matchups includes :


Nami vs Lafitte, Usopp vs Van Augur, Chopper vs Doc Q, Brooke vs Pizzaro (this one is interesting because i think one of Brooke next power up will be using his ability to leave his body to take over control of something/somebody else, making him fight someone who can do sort of that by taking control of an island can work), Franky vs San Juan Wolf.",1728
15qbo34,Blackbeard Pirates match up based on their potential vice and virtues,2023-08-13 22:02:41,"I think Brook first korw against Laffitte than Robin.

Laffitte has shown to have the ability to hypnotize people, whether it is from a DF or not is not known. We know he can seemigly sprout wings, but not how/why.
There's a theory that might have a siren fruit. In greek mythology, early on in the temples, siren were portrayed a birds with women's heads who sang hypnotising sailors to crash into their rocks to be drowned or eaten.

Brook, as he doesn't have a brian or ears, could be immune to sound based attacks.
Besides that, there are 2 occounts of individuals surviving the encounter with them. One of them was Odysseus, who was tied to the mast of the ship ( to become wiser from their song), while his crew had wax in their ears to not hear the sirens song. He also famously went into the underworld/afterlife.

The other was Orpheus with the Argonauts. Son of Apollo the Greek god of Music, he played lute so beautfily it silenced the Siren's song, and allowed his crew to pass by their rocks.
There's also a subjection on Wikipedia of Sirens and their ties to Death.
Which would tie Brook as a good opponent for him.

I'm hoping for a free for all. A huge crew match up. 
I could also see Vivi and Chopper vs Doc Q and Stronger 

Vasco was shown be a pervert, I could see him either going Robin (or even Nami), but Sanji could intervene be his opponent.",1366

He was doing great right before the time skip. Then like a tiny bit after. The Dressrosa arc is where I stopped liking him again. He's pretty much tried to abandon his crew at every turn since then when things get rough. He's still a selfish coward. He is the Buggy of the Strawhat crew. 

While I'm down here in this hole I'm digging. Sanji is still a terrible womanizing pervert, but he at least has everyone's backs. He's a capital 'R' Romantic. The shit he pulled on Thriller Bark nearly made me hate him. I am super over the whole Brock schtick. I will barely give him a passing grade as honorable since unlike Usopp he's been making some improvements like in Whole Cake. However there's a good reason Zoro is first mate and not him.",818

You can see that his mentality and approach to just following orders is still there, but he still has some hard lines he won't cross, or attempts to bend the rules a bit if he can while still following orders. I disagree with people saying he's just a lapdog, no that would be Ryokugyu. Kizaru was more than willing to take charge of the situation last chapter and directly planned out the assault himself rather than go with Saturn's suggestions while still following his orders.

I think we're about to learn more about Kizaru's philosophy and why he chooses to follow orders regardless of their nature. It seems more out of personal belief rather than a lack of a spine. Even during his fight with Sentomaru he was reminiscing fondly on their past and he opted to not kill him while still brutally incapacitating him. And he's still very regretful over having to kill Vegapunk but that seemed like a non-negotiable part of the operation so there was only so much he can do there.

This will probably be the first time we get to see an Admiral go all out so I'm really hoping for a good showing. I don't think Luffy will beat Kizaru outright though.

Kizaru legit just flexing on Sentomaru and using his wit to take the pacifistas back was a REALLY awesome touch, sucks that the sea beasts had to get taken out to get there but they can always just make more. If York ends up surviving, we know they'll come up with more. The pacifistas were definitely the right call. Their shared backstory is really awesome and makes their encounter even more sad, Sentomaru knew he didn't have a chance, all he needed to do was buy Stella and co time to get off the island and I hope that 4 vegapunks working together will cancel out York's bullshit. She seems incredibly confident that her code won't be broken.

It's admittedly pretty dumb that they let Lucci walk around as much as he was able to, but I think after everything that's happened and them fighting together, I think everyone just wanted moments to chill without worrying. Thing is, how would they have done it?! Seastone cuffs would surely make their healing nowhere near as effective and as we saw with Sanji putting Kaku in a bubble, it doesn't seem to have much space for recovery. SH being good people definitely fucked them over and poor Stussy paid the price. Hate to see it. She's more than likely okay but damn.

But the big clencher, Luffy v Kizaru. Something that we've all wanted to see for a very long time, an Emperor v an Admiral and who knows how long this battle is going to take?! We can assume not long simply because the SH NEED to escape, they don't really have a lot of time to waste unless Luffy tells them to go and then uses his awakening to slow everyone down while they make their escape.

Lucci just staying a villain through and through might be disappointing or annoying to some, but I dunno, at least he's reliable in that regard.

This all reads like Edgy Piece. We don't need someone cheap shot shock effects. Akainu, BB and Imu all did plenty to make them worth of Luffy's ire, although Akainu at least as a Marine had more points to his actions.",511

15ws1ov,What are you most worried won't match your expectations?,2023-08-21 00:33:55,"I feel like the luffy blackbeard fight will start with luffy running through jis gears until blackbeard realizes that hes gonna lose if he lets him keep that up and uses the yami yami no mi to completely disable luffys devil fruit powers, maybe even stealing it through his awakening, which would lead to luffy just straight throwing hands till the end of the fight, mirroring kaido talking about how haki trumps all. Eventually blackbeard gets worn down and luffy gets his fruit back and beats him with a gomu gomu no pistol, the first attack we saw him use

Sidenote, i also really hope that blackbeard drowns, the whole story drowning has been a threat to devil fruit users but weve never seen it happen. Having blackbeard drown would be poetic as hes a dark mirror of luffy, but in his quest for power he decked his whole crew out with fruits, meaning none of them could save him when hes most vulnerable, whereas luffy has plenty that could do it for him",959

Shanks and Dragon I‚Äôm not too concerned about. Same with Imu. But Blackbeard so far post time skip has been neglected. I assumed after the timeskip the Blackbeard pirates would be developed more. Blackbeard would be a terrifying presence haunting the new world. 

We got offscreen BB pirates getting pudding and then BB pulling up to get Hancocks fruit and then running away in fear of Rayleigh. 

The BB pirates so far are meh and not really terrifying or a presence. They kinda seem like a bunch of chums following Bb around. 

Oda literally could make this group the most fascinating villain group by exploring group dynamics and each character. 

Take half of dragged out wano screen time and give it to the black beard pirates in developing them as proper villains. Honestly would be a better turn out than what we got. 

In my opinion, what oda did with kaido and wano as a whole was really really bad. I think he started off excited and just realized the arc was too long and didn‚Äôt really have a plan for how luffy was gonna beat kaido and what kaidos goals were.

They might all seem daunting on paper, but ultimately, is there really any doubt that Zoro will one day defeat Mihawk and become the World's Strongest Swordsman, or that we'll discover the ancient histories of the world through Robin, or that Brook will be reunited with Laboon?

Except, what happens if Sunny develops a Klabautermann, the ship spirit that only manifests when a ship is dying?  Oda has teased us with Sunny's destruction a few times already, and the ship represents Franky's dream.  There's also Chopper's, Usopp's, and Sanji's dreams, which are each fairly vague and abstract, even when they seem to be defined in theory - Sanji himself has acknowledged that the All Blue could very well be a myth.  This doesn't even go into Luffy's dream, which hasn't actually been defined for us yet.

But, to be honest, I'm worried for Nami's dream the most.  The world is huge, so huge that the only way that I can see her achieving her dream would be if it happened off screen after a sizeable timeskip, or perhaps in an epilogue.  As it currently stands, they would have to travel the Grand Line at least six more times for coverage of Paradise alone - if not more than that, when you consider the fact that initial pose directions are random, and they have a one-in-seven shot of path selection from the start - and this isn't even accounting for the islands that log poses *won't* point to.  Not to mention discrepancies like the fact that they aborted their starting route after Little Garden, and instead followed an Eternal Pose to Alabasta,  Unless they find an Eternal Pose to whichever island came after Little Garden, assuming that island isn't Drum Island or Alabasta, they're going to have to camp out on Little Garden for a year to continue that chain.  And that's just one aspect of their initial trek across Paradise, not The New World, or either of the calm belts and Blues, or any of the sky islands or undersea countries that they haven't already been to.

Nami likely has the most difficult dream to accomplish of them all.  I have no doubt that they'll all help her accomplish it or die trying, but I don't think that we'll actually get to see it play out.  At best, we're most likely going to be told that she has accomplished it, but that will be about it.  That being said, I would absolutely love it if some day after the story is finished, Oda or his team publish ""Nami's Atlas"", which describes and goes into at least some detail about each island in the world.  It wouldn't have to be manga or anything, just, basically, a publicized version of what Nami herself is creating.",2652

1- Usopp‚Äôs character arc not being satisfactory (hoping it will be on Elbaf but we know what happened with Franky on Egghead)

2- Final war not living up to expectations - with so many characters and factions being straw hats, Blackbeard pirates, world government, the gorosei, revolutionaries, straw hat allies (grand fleet, honorary members e.g. vivi, yamato) and prolly more that I forgot, there is a LOT of pressure for this to be one of the greatest arcs. However, since Oda said he wants to finish one piece by 2025 that only gives oda 2 years of real time to write it, and realistically it‚Äôll be a lot less unless he‚Äôs planning on some catastrophe which happens before Elbaf, which might happen in my opinion to be fair. But even if he does, that‚Äôs still only gonna be 102 chapters if he takes NO breaks which he absolutely will so it‚Äôs more like 70 chapters imo. I think he‚Äôs gonna end up realising one piece will take a lot more time to wrap up than the 2025 deadline he‚Äôs given himself personally.

People who like the toon shenanigans will love it and people who don't won't, because 1072 will be an absolute clownshow. And I don't even mean that disrespectful, it's just a fitting description imo. G5 is the opposite of what some people would describe as epic.",374

Gear 5 is not a transformation for the masses, it's a more unique and niche one. It will never reach the heights of UI Goku, SSJ, or SSJ2, because it's not your typical bad ass, ""I'm angy now grrrr"" -type of transofrmation. Gear 5 works perfectly in the sense of One Piece, but don#t be surprised if non One Piece fans will trash it, or simply not like it. It makes sense.

For me personally it is easily one of the best power ups, if not even the best in shonen history.

The episode itself didn't really make it justice tho, but I still enjoyed it. BUT I REALLY love the power up as a concept.

I hope the next episode has cleaner animation and lets the cartoony effects breathe more, and better pacing throughout the episode would help too, but I know and will accept that it will simply not break the internet like UI did, AND IT'S OK.

15laykk,This is the episode we should be hyped about!!!,2023-08-08 07:31:24,"It's really sad that ""no cutaways no flashbacks"" is special. 

Over the course of a decade one piece's anime dropped in quality so bad imo. Back then (punk hazard) you would see through episodes on end with either no time filling material or it wasn't noticeable. Then (dressrosa) you'd see more frequently than is good unnecessary flashbacks and reused animations.

During WCI I think it hit its worst with not only unnecessary flashbacks and reused animations but also really poor quality animations, to the point that they can't even be called animations just completely still images being moved across the screen. 

Now I would say it's a little bit better than that but still not very good, the animation itself has gotten pretty good, I really don't like the direction it has gone with all of the flashing lasers but the animation itself is fine. Every single episode has flashbacks to the previous episode and reused pieces of animation. The worst is after the mid episode break there will usually be like a solid minute of the same animation and scenes just being played again. It is blatantly time filling. I really wish they would go to seasonal or do filler episodes or release episodes every other week or something because it is the time filling strategies that have kind of ruined the show for me. 


Which is really sad because it is such an amazing story, the manga is fantastic The characters are also charming, I wish the anime did it justice anymore.",1469

1015 is probably not going to be matched anytime soon because despite having the amazing shadows-style of animation (incredible) it had coherent flow within everything that was happening and no cut felt too boring or lame. 

If direction is on point, it can be a great episode even if animation sucks, because there is nothing more that we like that fluid-well-paced-sequences.

15laykk,This is the episode we should be hyped about!!!,2023-08-08 07:31:24,"I have to admit, I never understood the G5 hype, like at all...

I'm a person who stopped reading the manga after Zou, and completely retreated from all One Piece communities everywhere to hide from spoilers until I decided to catch up again. And I didn't read One Piece again for years and years.

After chapter 1044 was released, I started catching One Piece mentions in the wild‚Äîstuff like deleted comments on unrelated subreddits, complete with replies yelling at the commenter for spoiling the *thing* that just happened in One Piece. So I figured: okay, something big has happened, I should probably catch up. I spent the next couple months reading (which was great, Whole Cake Island and Wano were both great!), but when I reached chapter 1044, I was like... that's it? A power-up? It's a cool and fun power-up to be sure, but... it's just a power-up. And the nature of Luffy's fruit is different than we thought it was. I guess that's interesting, but it wasn't *mind-blowing*.

I was kind of underwhelmed.

I suppose all of the G5 stuff is *cool*, but I didn't feel any emotion tied to it. The ending of Marineford, now *that* is a spoiler that pulls the rug out from under the reader, and it's wrapped up in so much emotion, for both the reader and the characters. G5 is like.. huh, interesting lore change I guess. This fight is fun? But that's it. No emotion, really. (The emotional part of the ending of Wano is all wrapped up in the very end of the arc, imo, and it has less to do with the Strawhats than with the inhabitants of Wano itself.)

Anyway. I've found all of the hype regarding this episode a little confusing and a little misguided. I feel like anime-onlys may have been kind of misled regarding what to expect here.",1742

Either way most of these work quite nicely while others could have used a bit more planning.

Most obviously the Vivi thing is pretty nonsensical when you think about it.

In the original plans, Ace probably used his mother's last name as a way to disown his hated father, and the S on his tattoo was just a tattoo artist's mistake.

Changing Ace's father allowed Oda to keep the Revolutionary Army out of the already crowded Battle of Marineford.

Also, by killing him, he created an excellent dramatic moment for a time skip and established Sakazuki as one of the manga ultimate villains along with Blackbeard.

Sabo was created to take Ace's place in the Dragon and Revolutionary Army future storyline, and the S on Ace's tattoo now takes on a whole new meaning.

People usually forget that retcon is just another storytelling tool, and it's not wrong to use it when needed.

What separates a good retcon from a bad one is how well it is integrated into the story and whether the reader is able to recognize it.

This isn't Oda's best retcon, but it works well enough with the rest of the story to the point that many readers never notice.",983

Now whether Dragon was intended to be Luffy's father or Garp his grandfather, I couldn't guess, but it's possible Oda already planned for these at-the-time mysterious characters to be related to Luffy or he came up with it afterwards. Either way, unless Ace was intended to be Luffy's half brother, Dragon would have been his biological father. Could've even have had the anger issues too since Dragon left and Ace would have been 3 and old enough to remember him.",707

Ace for example, I never believed for one second he was >!Luffy's blood brother.  I always, ALWAYS questioned why he was calling himself Portgas instead of Monkey and the whole him hating his dad just didn't make sense when you had Luffy going by that name. Yet Ace was using his mum's name but Luffy never mentioned his Mum? There was some fishy crap going on there and so for me the only logical thing that made sense was that Luffy and Ace were step-brothers and not actually related. I did not predict he was Roger's kid but god that was a great reveal when I was reading it the first time. First finding out he really wasn't related to Luffy and how I was right to WTF when he was revealed as Roger's kid and having the shock of my life. Great Time. Wish I could go back to those days.!<

It's the same thing with Naruto and who his dad was. Supposedly that was never planned either, yet when watching og Naruto and seeing the >!4ft Hokage's portrait and how he had the blonde hair and blue eyes and Itachi referred to Naruto as the 4ft's Legacy, I just assumed that was the case but it wasn't at the time which is just weird to think about when rewatching because that was not planned, yet it feels like it was. !<

Call it crazy coincidences, but sometimes it feels like creators try to tie things together and luck would just have it that they can easily do that with how they've already written and set up the story, so it just fits like a puzzle.",1541

15oyiw9,If ace being Roger's son wasn't planned from the beginning who could have been ace's dad originally? Dragon?,2023-08-12 08:01:45,"I love this post! Some of these examples really feel spontaneous when you think about how they were introduced.

Vivi started out as just another number in Baroque Works I wonder how quickly Oda decided to upgrade her to Princess? A few weeks at most. 

I wonder if Originally Oda had Marineford ending with only Luffy just escaping but threw Shanks in last minute for hype. Maybe Oda really had planned for Kaidou to show up originally? 

Lucci not being a villain makes a lot of sense. I always thought Lucci‚Äôs backstory was especially tragic (basically being a child soldier/slave for the WG) and I bet Oda originally planned for him to not accept the WG but then decided to go in this direction. Hell even now in the story Lucci is acting as an ally for the moment so good guy Lucci is still in the cards lol

I could see Coraz√≥n originally designed as just a marine undercover agent. There really wasn‚Äôt anything about him that coded him as a CD so it feels like he was just connected to Doffy last minute during conception because Oda thought that would be cool. 

Feels like Oda is one of those people that let his characters ‚Äúlive their own life.‚Äù As in he doesn‚Äôt try to force a narrative out of them he creates them and then let‚Äôs his imagination run wild with what they can do.

We can see parts of this rivalry in Wano in the prison competing for food and then competing to get to Kaido.

I thought it was pretty creative to deal with a lot of them at once by having them join with various yonko, but it felt like another warlord situation where oda wasn‚Äôt prepared to write the stories for so many new players 

Knowing that they were planned to have even less impact makes me grateful oda found a way to implement them in a way that makes the world feel full and organic, albeit a bit disappointing",481

It gives off a darker, grittier tone due to the darker colours, the fire looks...better? And the faces are more expressive. Also the board and bodies seem to be better proportioned and larger in the original, and looks thicker, sturdier.

Cowboy Bebop (up to Ed showing up), Street Fighter Assassins Fist, Halo Forward Unto Dawn, Mortal Kombat 1, Rurouni Kenshin, Last of Us,  The First Transformer Movie (2nd one was....aight), etc All Good.  


Honorable Mention- Season 1 of Arrow, Flash, Stargirl, Legends of Tomorrow where good but each one slowly or quickly got lackluster after season 1

166moun,One Piece Live Action is now certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes,2023-08-31 20:52:36,"Does anyone else simultaneously understand why someone would think it's terrible but still personally enjoy it? It's like a campy B movie with an extremely high budget. On the surface it seems to suffer from the same problem that a lot of anime adaptions do, the characters look like ridiculous cosplayers, it's impossible to take seriously, and the world isn't really believable despite how much money went into set design, but somehow it works anyway and you want to keep watching.

I think it comes down to how they embraced the campiness and the ridiculousness to the point where it's fun to watch and the characters are so endearing that you don't have to take it seriously. Translated into real life, the world of One Piece is practically surrealist, the fact that the source material has never strived to craft a ""realistic"" world but instead throws fantastical magical elements together with ambiguous levels of technological development and a hodgepodge of disparate cultures and character designs removes the need to explain the nonsensical things.",1058

But the series is actually fun, engaging, and... it just feels right somehow. Yeah, the looks are cosplay-level, but honestly, that's so much better than failing it or losing the creative touch by trying too hard.

3 Episodes in I just wonder:

- What's Chopper gonna look like?
- What about Brook?
- Franky?!

They pulled off Buggy SO good I'm not even worried; I'm excited!

The visual effects artists and actors are really making this come together so well. It's fun to look at, not over-engineered or under-budgeted.

Now, the only problem I have with Netflix is how they'll likely dial down the VFX costs immensely (except for that one episode per season) and surprise-cancel it at some point like so many shows before it.

Honestly, I doubt these actors will even age out of their roles due to the pacing and it‚Äôd be nice to have an understanding of time through aging actors (think time skip and how ripped the crew gets) aging there would be the move. Anyway, sorry for saying what clearly everyone‚Äôs thinking for what seems like the thousandth time but it‚Äôs awesome to see this get such good feedback cus I can‚Äôt wait for more of this. Just gonna say a few characters that will light this series on fire (pun intended): Ace (obviously), Enel is gonna be fun, Law (personal fave One Piece character), and I think there will be A LOT of fun with the whole Crocodile arc and Robin.

wpuld a more faithful adaption be better sure but no one here wants to see 1000plus episodes of live action one piece so the cuts and changes really help the pacing

I mean yeah I'm kinda sad that they didn't do ussops big nose or sanjis eyebrow but I liked that they made a new logo for every episode

I also love the instrumentals of we are and binks brew though when buggy sang a chanty on the going merry I kinda hoped it would be binks brew

the only changes I don't like are that merry died and the heavy accent that garp has (and possibly that alvida won't be slim for season 2 in loguetown that's not against the actor she portrayed alvida perfectly but in loguetown luffy is supossed to not recognize her due to her body changing)

also I really loved that they gave us small buggy

overall this show is the peak that a live action anime adapatation can be at this time and I do hope that we get the full thing

if they continue this pacing then it should turn out to be 15 seasons total probably (1 season for each of the 11 arcs plus a bit of breathing room) though I'm sure we won't get more than a season per year so I'm interested on how they'll handle the aging of the actors",1324

we all enjoyed the hell out of it! the casting alone is phenomenal, the chemistry and dynamic amongst the crew is excellent. many times i felt myself grinning from ear to ear. it has been the perfect mix of realism and campy, goofy and action. 

it is almost like zoro got lost at some point and ended up on the set of the live action and they just started rolling.

(a personal fav little tidbit is i love how they are doing the bounty posters‚Äî just one little thing where you can tell the effort that has gone into this adaptation.)

as a death note, dbz, and cowboy bebop fan, it has been excellent to see an animanga turned into an actually good LA. props to everyone who worked on it, and i can‚Äôt wait to finish the episodes!",839

Manga/anime was a bit boring for me until along park arc, but the live action series has a very logical progression and more entertaining approach.

166moun,One Piece Live Action is now certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes,2023-08-31 20:52:36,"2 episodes in and im hoping we get a s2. The actors were chosen quite well (apart from one which i will talk about), Luffy constantly saying (im monkey d luffy and im gonna be king of the pirates) every episode like its his pokemon sound is just annoying and the gum gum crap is a lil cringy but its accurate so i cant complain.

Zoro is by far my favourite part of the show which is odd cos i really don't care for him in the anime or manga, especially pre-timeskip. Nami's alright ig, can't really complain and idk why but shanks just feels right.

HOWEVER, they made 1 massive mistake that i cannot stand by, the made Garp, the most respected and feared dude in the marine corps FUCKING WELSH. Thats just fucking cruel and now my opinion has changed on him as a character",774

I think a lot of people need to keep in mind that what would be most reasonable would be 8 seasons over the next 10-12 years. That is Game of Thrones level success and we're talking 1 in 10,000 shows even getting that chance.

Also worth noting that based on the fact that as the anime/manga went on, sometimes dozens of chapters/episodes were devoted to fights that really only take 2-4 minutes in the show, you could reasonably cut out a lot of run time. This is awesome, because it'll make the story much more palatable. I wrote out a rough version of the first 5 seasons assuming 8 episodes per season with an 8 season story wrap-up goal.

They would lose their existing audience if in future seasons they suddenly spent 50% of the season's episodes on a single arc.

Also you're missing a bunch of other important episodes, such post enies lobby, Ace vs BB and general world building episodes that could extend a thriller bark + sabaody season. Not to mention that no way in hell would the war be only 2 episodes.

Arlong Park was way too short imo, especially compared to the other arcs in this season, I think that‚Äôs why they introduced Arlong early and brought him into Baratie; they could build him up without waiting to crunch him in at the end.

The defeat at Sabaody is season finale material by itself, and Thriller Bark can afford some more expansion if Skypeia can manage five episodes - especially if the confrontation with Kuma can be given its own level of attention.  Marineford would *definitely* need more than two episodes, though.  It could probably run a full season on its own.

Strawhats will never go to Rainbase, but instead they will go straight to Alubarna. Luffy will fight Crocodile in Yuba and also be saved by Robin in Yuba. Pell will go to Yuba, instead of scouting Rainbase because Pell actually met Karoo on the way. The letter which Karoo is holding will probably state that Vivi is in Yuba and Pell decided to meet her there. King Cobra doesn't know Crocodile is the Ringleader until the Alubarna Civil War where Crocodile reveal himself as such.

Episode 7 - Alubarna Fight

Episode 8 - Defeat of Crocodile  and Post Arabasta.

I really think that they switch Davy Backfight to Pre Jaya to make Skypeia Season a little bit longer with 3 arcs. Davy BackFight will make Robin realize she is important to the crew eventhough she was just joined.

Ep 2 is reverse mountain where the important things are meeting Laboon and Crocus with their backstory, explanation of the logpose and getting to meet Vivi and mr 5 (not sure about the number) though we could easily meet her at Whiskey peak so I don't think this needs a full ep. Rather they could combine Whiskey peak with it somehow and lead up to Little Garden as these 3 mini arcs are important to building up Barok Woorks, Vivis request and Usopps dream to go to Elbaf.

Drum Island can once again be one ep easily to meet Chopper as we have spent that much time with each sh story in season 1.

Let's be real, whiskey peak is mostly good for the introduction of some characters, not the setting itself, and those intros could be easily folded into the other episodes.

In the same vein that we got to see Garp and Koby as the secondary story thread, the same will probably take place for Smoker and Tashigi, showing them hunting for the Straw Hats, but also dealing with other members of Baroque Works on the way.
* Season 3 could even have extra episodes showing what other characters aside from the Straw Hats are doing, there are the cover stories after all.
* Season 4 could have either an extra episode focusing on the Post Enies Lobby happenings, or have the end of the Davy Back Fight and the encounter with Aokiji;
* Season 5 could work like Skypiea, including cover stories and even the story of Ryuma maybe as a special, like Invincible did for Atom Eve. However, the season should end with the Straw Hats being split up, since it would be shocking for watchers and encourage them to watch the next season;
* Season 6 could expand on what the other Straw Hats are doing, Impel Down, the War, perhaps show Luffy and Ace's flashback earlier, and them end with everyone training for the new world.

1684110,"Based on Season 1, how I think subsequent seasons might be split.",2023-09-02 14:32:33,"I think this can be much more streamlined.

We need to consider that the Show has shown us they're not scared to change things around and outright cut content that is not either relevant or necessary to the story.

And how to blame them? Not only you never know if you're going to survive for another season with Netflix, but also, the actors aren't getting any younger, and considering the story takes place in the span of 2 years, time is not on our side.

So what do I intend by that? Season 2 can be approached in a number of ways - even though every single one of us agrees that it will adapt the whole of the Alabasta Saga.

First things first, Reverse Mountain and Whiskey Peak are extremely short and quick arcs, lacking memorable villains or necessary protagonist arcs; what I mean by that is that both can take half an episode length, and it would be perfectly fine.

So I would say, for Season 2; 1 episode for Loguetown, 1 for Reverse Mountain + Whiskey Peak, 1 for Little Garden, 2 for Drum Island, and whatever is left for Alabasta. Also, are we even going to Loguetown? Is it even possible that they could merge the events happening in Loguetown with those happening in Whiskey Peak? Now I'm a little more skeptical about this line of thought mainly because we have Smoker confirmed, but he can easily be at Whiskey Peak instead of Loguetown.

But Season 3 is something I think is worth talking about.

I love Skypeia, and I love Jaya even more. And I enjoy even Long Ring Long Land. But I legitimately don't believe Season 3 will be Jaya and Skypeia.

I think that Season 3 will be Water 7/Enies Lobby. Here's my reasoning.

The showrunners have shown us they are not afraid of changing the story. They pretty much took Post-Enies Lobby and put it during Season 1. Not only that, but again, time is not on their side, and we cannot really adapt the whole series, it would take way too long. What I believe will happen is the following; at the beginning of Season 3, we will have an island - be it Jaya, or be it something else entirely - in which the Straw Hats encounter Blackbeard, he has his famous speech and all. Have an easy villain of the week to fight off - probably Bellamy, just to have some fun, but he could be easily cut, so whoever is fine - and then, Aokiji arrives, scaring off Blackbeard and his men. Then you have the whole Water 7/Enies Lobby Saga. 

Yup. I think they might very well cut Skypeia entirely, especially considering that, for continuity's sake, a couple of workarounds will be all that's needed. I know it's an heresy, but I think they might do it, and we need to start preparing for this possibility - if Season 3 gets even greenlit at all, of course.

The only problem I see with this is that there will be practically zero time for the audience to get used to Nico Robin as a crewmember, but she can be built all throughout Season 2 and the first episode of Season 3 might be all about her. This is the only reason I can see this not working.

And then, Season 4 is the rest.",3027

Look at the latest season of Stranger Things. A couple of those episodes were almost two hours long.

I would love for them to do both tho, but I don‚Äôt think making a whole season of skypeia would make good tv for common viewers (gotta keep people watching if we want more seasons). And I prefer much more for them to develop more Sabaody-Marineford than to have thriller bark.",446

1684110,"Based on Season 1, how I think subsequent seasons might be split.",2023-09-02 14:32:33,"I think Whiskey Peak, LRLL , and RM don't need full episodes to themselves, and I don't think Skypeia and maybe Enies Lobby need that many either. If we get more seasons we might get more episodes a season and the show won't have to rush as much, but even so we could save some time in some of these arcs. 

One thing about the actors aging is they can play it off like more time has passed between seasons than in the manga/anime. Loguetown is _right after_ the end of the East Blue Arc so that's a no go there, but the show can imply more time passes between the end of Alabasta and Jaya. Have short cutaway flashbacks to live action only adventures or nods to things in the movies or what have you to sell the idea. That's an option.",736

It's the best anime adaptation I've seen from them, but it's still lacking an awful lot. I think it's done its job of reaching a wider demographic though, getting people interested in the source material. I have a cap with Law's jolly roger on it and in the past year I've had more people than ever recognise it and talk about it, which I think can be attributed to the show.

1684110,"Based on Season 1, how I think subsequent seasons might be split.",2023-09-02 14:32:33,"Tbh i wouldnt mind if they made the season 2 in 2 parts with pre alabasta being 6 episodes and Alabasta being the other 5 so action scenes , wackiness and the sad scene can be properly shown. After such a long season they can make the next one shorter like 7 episodes but imo they Long Ring and W7 should be another 5 or 6 episodes an Enies should be the remaining 5 or 6 for total of 11 episodes. After that they can make the next season short again with 6 episodes 3 Thriller Bark and 3 Sabaody and make  new season for Lily , Impel Down and Marine Ford for another banger 11 episodes.

Season 2 (11 episodes in 2 part of 6 pre Alabasta and 5 for Alabasta) 

Season 3 Jaya and Skypeia(7 Episodes)

 Season 4 (11 Episodes in 2 parts with 5-6 or 6-5 split again) 

Season 5 (6 Episodes up to end ofSabaody) 

Season 6 (11 Epidoes for the Peak Piece)


I dont think there is any stipulation that all seasons should have same amount of chapters right? As long as they announce the amount of episodes for the season beforehand i really dont think there will be backlash for it to be less",1084

I recently rewatched the anime version and while i still love it, it drags on for me. Many of the arcs could have been cut down and still gotten the core messaging across.

Im very curious about where and how far they plan to take this show.

Spoilers for newcomers ahead:

Just Smoker alone is a challenge to do as a Logia. From the Baroque Works scenes I think we have at the very least another full season that will include Loguetown (2ep), Reverse Mountain and Laboon(1ep) and Baroque Works (3ep) and (Edit) Drum Island(4ep)
How they could possibly manage to fit the entirety of Alabasta in season 2 is beyond me. 
(Edit) Alabasta itself is probably gonna be season 3.

The air I am getting from the show is an intention to complete the Alabasta Saga.

Just the sheer massive resources required to do anything after that just does not seem feasible. How the heck does a show like  this make Chopper looks as good as rocket racoon consistently.  I just can't see that being on Netflix's radar.",845

People also need to remember they are integrating PARTS OF THE STORY THE MANGA IS ON CURRENTLY AND ADAPTING THE KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE A FLUID AND ENJOYABLE VIEW FOR NEWCOMERS AND DAY 1 FANS TO STAY INITIATED AND INVESTED IN A STORT THEY ARENT DAMILIAR WITH FULLY.

If you (the viewer) go into it expecting it to be a 1 to 1 of the Manga story wise as well as WHAT WAS LATER SHOWN IN FUTURE CHAPTERS AND SBS, you may be initially disappointed (personally I wasn't it made it more enjoyable to watch imo). 

However, they do an AMAZING job of integrating story components to keep you interested but still maintain the heart and soul of one piece to perfection.

With that being said, if you are a TRUE DIE HARD FAN and are DISAPPOINTED AFTER WATCHING because it doesn't follow the story to a T, you don't appreciate just how much work it is to make this level of high quality series and dont recognize how much DETAIL was paid to the show.

166ndl7,I binge watched the entire season today and oh boy it was soo good!,2023-08-31 21:17:33,"EDIT : I see some controversy here, let me give you some more of my thoughts here that might ease you up a little bit

The changes and edits that were made are an acceptable change to me, why ?? 

Considering the original East Blue Saga was done almost 20-22 years ago by Oda, the changes Oda has made to the live action adaptation are okay because it‚Äôs Oda‚Äôs story, and if the final outcome of the story is same then small storyline edits that don‚Äôt play major role as per story wise are okay. 

I know many parts didn‚Äôt hit the same level of emotion as it did in the anime or manga but you know what ? I still cried at every single moment i cried in anime, i cried when shanks got his hand chopped off and he hugs luffy and says it‚Äôs just an arm

I cried at zoro‚Äôs story when her best friend died, i cried at Sanji‚Äôs story when he finds out about the old man didn‚Äôt had any food and he gave all his food to him so he can survive, i cried when Nami was shouting Arlong while removing his tattoo and crying and luffy came and said of course i will

So for me none of those main emotions changed. You can disagree with my opinion here but this is what i felt when i watched the live action

Infact these small storyline edits and changes is what kept me hooked and wondering what could Oda sensei have planned next. This excitement is what kept me hooked 

And in the end it ended just like it was supposed to be

Even the garp part was good, i loved how he spent time with koby and giving more value to the koby character as well. 

You guys are literally comparing it with anime and nit picking, I understand your emotions are attached to the show, but don‚Äôt you think directors of this show and Oda sensei didn‚Äôt knew that ? 

Didn‚Äôt they know what they are doing ? That they will be criticised for this, but they still did it. 

If you are all true one piece fan, try to think a little out of the box for a moment, this is still East Blue Saga, this is still Oda‚Äôs imagination, this is still those same characters, this is still the same One Piece just with some newly added twist and little bit of cool and welcome plot changes",2131

This adaption is BAD. I can recognize some strengths - like good casting and chemistry.

But the plot is a ""One Piece Speedrun"" and heavy Nostalgia Bait.

Its like buggy himself directed it to be flashy, but without the soul

&#x200B;

Rewatch episodes 5-8 of anime

compare to episode 2 of live action.

&#x200B;

There is a difference between soul and flash.

For someone like my girlfriend who never watched one piece before, i showed her both.

The live action she doesnt care about the characters at all.

&#x200B;

The anime she loves the character moments and actual cares about them as people.

I mean I get that they need to do some cuts in order to fit the east blue saga, but some of them are the memorable ones. The comedic sense of the ONE PIECE series wasn‚Äôt there at all which is kind of sad because it made the show a more serious kind of ONE PIECE than the original which
Was more balanced in comedic and seriousness.
But I can‚Äôt hate because the casting, CG, and Easter eggs were good. If there is going to be season 2 I wish they would put more effort in showing the memorable moments that made us cry or lifted us, beachside those moments and the story are the ones that make the entire series interesting and gets us hooked.

I tried that, but I'm pretty sure you're giving it too much of a benefit with this. You're not only purposefully ignoring your knowledge of how much better some scenes could've been, you're still most likely adding your knowledge to other scenes making them appear better.

What the manga and anime, puts on the back burner a little more is the human - behind the scenes interaction and I think the live action does it very well!  

The Baratie party part, I loved it, and the way Zoro and Sanji bicker is amazing. I love love loved Buggy interpration, way scarier and crazy as it should, As well as Kody, his looks and voice and whole body language is just the way I imagine it myself.

166ndl7,I binge watched the entire season today and oh boy it was soo good!,2023-08-31 21:17:33,"Indeed it was! Made me laugh a couple of times, and Buggy was the perfect balance of menacing and hilarious! Honestly, the cast did a great job of portraying the characters without making it ""cringy"". Can't think of a better word for it, but Luffy being hyper-enthusiastic wouldn't translate well into Live Action, and though it was toned down, I√±aki did an amazing job at keeping the core of Luffy's character despite the change in mediums.

The added Nami-Zoro and Nami-Kaya interactions are unexpected, but not unwelcome. Though these are but little changes, the depth it added to each character involved is such a neat touch. Usopp is also charismatic as all hell, and I ain't surprised he got all that rizz. Sanji's more suave compared to his counterpart, and it's a change most welcome.

The music, the set pieces, and all the casts' costume designs are done so well with such intricacies, and I'm amazed at how the behind-the-scenes crew were able to put together a world like One Piece come to life.

Of course, it's not all sunshines and rainbows, and I do have some issues with it, but overall, it's a strong 7.5/10 for me. Some scenes didn't have the same impact as it did in canon, and there are some changes in both character writing and story that made me think... why, but.

166ndl7,I binge watched the entire season today and oh boy it was soo good!,2023-08-31 21:17:33,"I have to rewatch the last 2 episodes because I feel asleep (it was after 4am). It was much better than I expected. It was good enough that my wife stayed up 6am to finish the episodes, and she doesn't watch anime or read manga. I don't think she knows what the show is, but enjoyed it all the same. It had the feel of a Pirates film. 

I want season 2 to do more daytime fights, and properly work Usopp into the story, instead of a background character. The Water7 episode might not happen until S3, but we need to build up Usopp's role in that time. He kept Merry going, and given how they emphasized Luffy's attraction to the boat, they have to make that whole season emotional. Merry was a SH, and Usopp was integral to that story. I think the Kaya episodes showed some potential for the Usopp character. 

Oda better stay on top of things. Don't George RR Martin this thing. See it through to the end. His input certainly seems to have helped, as this new truncated story still hits the key moments. 

Best cast members are Zoro and Luffy. They feel like how I imagined both characters in live action. Nami was decent. Usopp was not great. Then again, I wouldn't want a 1:1 on manga Usopp. That would be grating. Buggy was a very interesting take that worked for me. Zeff was also great. Axehand was meh. Garp and Koby are interesting. Garp's character is getting some meat I think the manga failed up deliver. I also like that Koby player a role is that development. But Koby for real needs to take multiple levels in badass, because he's somehow even meeker than his pathetic self in the manga.

I understand having the Marines pursue them for longer gives the season more of a through line and creates a sense of urgency, I feel like it makes Garps characterization kind of weird, and the whole point of Coby imo is you don't see him for 10 years and then you're surprised how much he's grown.",419

If I ever got to talk with Oda off camera I think I'd like to ask him about the sanji tropes and if it wouldn't make more sense for sanji to show his ""respect"" for women in a less pervy way? Although maybe that's like his ""criminal trait"" just how it's morally wrong for Nami to steal ig, and maybe it's supposed to be some negative development from being in a womanless island for 2 years. I think it would be pointless to ask about the pacing since Oda probably just wants to write ""stories"" with the new characters he introduces with the facade that it's taking place in the one piece world? Or maybe they are just extra long to ensure that we get the context cause ig it's better to have it than not have it and feel like everything has been rushed",879

That being said, what this post implies also seems to be misrepresentative and a bit of a straw-man argument, as I haven‚Äôt seen any posters complaining that there was an utter lack of humor in past arcs or fights - just that the humor and gags in the past were never done to the point that it compromised the seriousness of the situation.

Water Balloon Luffy, mini-post-G3 Luffy and airhead Luffy were relatively brief (in terms of the overall arc and/or fight) gag moments that were quickly overshadowed by more serious moments. Luffy didn‚Äôt beat Croc / Lucci / Enel with those forms, and the gag dissipated as the stakes were dialed up. That wasn‚Äôt really the case with Gear 5, which turned the entirety of what was supposed to be a dire situation (and the climax of the arc) involving a top level threat (a Yonko that had been built up for a decade) to a far less serious one.

There is nothing wrong with liking Gear 5‚Äôs design or effects, but I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs accurate to compare it‚Äôs impact or scope to something as brief, insignificant and unimpactful as Water Balloon Luffy. I also think that it‚Äôs inaccurate to prop up arguments that were never actually made by any large amount of viewers - no major amount of posters have claimed that past One Piece fights were devoid of humor, just that the humor wasn‚Äôt done to the point that it compromised the stakes.",1542

He‚Äôs got two brain cells and it‚Äôs for meat and friends respectively. 

Series is a lighthearted story with dark elements sprinkled around. I‚Äôm an arc with so much loss, luffy is the light at the end of the tunnel, hes bringing peace to a country which is drowning in sorrow. 

So yea gear 5 isn‚Äôt going to be some stoic no emotion transformation where he fights all serious, no talking. ultra instinct is good on goku because while he‚Äôs strong he‚Äôs like a dad when fighting always having fun talking and even encouraging his enemy/trying to teach them a lesson. UI is the we‚Äôre done talking here‚Äôs your asswooping mode that fits goku. 

Luffy has those modes as well but it‚Äôs usually ONCE he‚Äôs mastered a transformation AND even then it‚Äôs still goofy at the end or when he‚Äôs running out of steam. 

All the criticism about gear 5 aren‚Äôt from fans of one piece. Not saying if you criticize gear 5 you aren‚Äôt a fan but specifically all the circle jerks and shitting on OP on social media and YouTube are just attention whores who see a chance to get a few likes because One piece fans hyped themselves up when this moment was a standard One Piece end of the arc fight, the cool part is the mystery about the transformation and the WHOLE fight in general. The hype isn‚Äôt solely on the drums of liberation and the transformation, it‚Äôs cool but it ain‚Äôt no super Saipan or gons transformation.

No lasers.

No unnecessary lightning.

No glowing aura.

No repeated animations.

Not as many unnecessary flashbacks 

No seizure warnings necessary 

I love the one piece manga and it is fantastic.

The anime peaked from The first episode of Ennis lobby to the last episode of fishman Island.


In this clip there are lasers because a creature is firing lasers. There is a crater because a character did a big punch.
The animations are clean and quick. 

In everything from whole cake island onwards:

Luffy looks (zoom in on him)

Enemy looks (zoom in on them)

Flashback to last episode where the enemy said something bad

Back to Luffy, zoom on him (reused)

Luffy says I'm not going to let you keep being a bad guy!

Luffy jumps forward

Enemy jumps forward

Luffy jumps forward again, traveling across the ground mid jump

Enemy does the same

Repeat two more times

Luffy brings back his arm and coats it with haki, It begins to glow, he gets a laser outline, lightning crackles

Focus on this for a minute and a half

Enemy jumps forward also covered in laser and lightning crackles

They connect, The punch is held for two and a half minutes wiggling back and forth between them

Ground explodes into cubes

(Was not even a named attack)


Also why the fuck is everything so shaky and blurry.",1336

1653ma0,Straw Hats arrive at Baratie |OPLA New Clip,2023-08-30 03:31:26,So is the whole season dropping tmr or just episode by episode?,63

1653ma0,Straw Hats arrive at Baratie |OPLA New Clip,2023-08-30 03:31:26,"I‚Äôm really impressed with the scale here. In the anime and manga, it feels relatively small. It feels more like docking a normal ass boat at a small dock. It just doesn‚Äôt feel like this big, famous restaurant floating out in the middle of the sea that‚Äôs a big attraction. 

But in this, it genuinely feels like a big deal. There are tons of people milling about, a whole bunch of big ships, the restaurant feels bigger, the bar in the mouth, etc. It really sells the idea that this is a floating food paradise in the middle of the east blue, attracting sailors from all over.",575

15ieez7,"People who tell newbies to skip the Skypiea arc, what's wrong with you?",2023-08-04 22:43:45,"Skypia was my favorite. The 3 different parties, all fighting against everyone felt like a battle royal. 
Enel had mysterious powers that we never saw before and it felt like we where always in danger. 
Chopper was new to the crew and constantly stressed of all the dangers. The town was against the straw hats.
The helpless feeling when luffy had that big gold ball around his arm and needed to climb that insanely large tree. 

And skypia was really funny. E.g. when zorro made tarzan screams while swinging the lianes and saying Nami failed because she didnt tarzan scream and when luffy imitated sanji, or ysopp vs enel. 

People always love when the straw hats are together and having an adventure but not for skypia?
Zorro saving Robin, Nami in need of Luffys help again because of some sexist asshole, Sanji with some big brain moments which I always love and they are pretty rare nowadays.

The party around the fire with the wolves is a panel where we see luffys silhouette looking like the sun god nika. 

ALSO didnt we see the ghost of the ship repairing the going merry at night in this arc? Not sure anymore.

The ending of the fight is one of the best.

Also I like jungles.",1188

I know I stopped being as excited about the story when I got to it and a lot of the people I recommended One piece to straight up stopped because of it.

First time I watched it I absolutely loved it, even the slow parts, it just felt like a fun exploring adventure wich I think at that point was Oda's aim for the story. 

Also, people that says ""nothing happens"" is lying. They found the mf 1rst Poneglyph there.  Roger was there. The crew becomes rich. Also there's always an open door for Enel's return",387

15ieez7,"People who tell newbies to skip the Skypiea arc, what's wrong with you?",2023-08-04 22:43:45,"There was some validity to the claim way back in the day pre timeskip and only to someone who was watching casually. Some people never become ""hooked"" and never really become a fan of the series but will just watch it occasionally. That's the type of person I could understand skipping skypedia back in 2007 because rhey are likely forgetting plot points and missing out on details anyway since they are taking long breaks between watching episodes and sometimes not paying full attention. 


In my opinion, if you're not gonna give it your full attention anyway then skipping an arc that is widely known to be slow paced and less action packed in the anime than people had come to expect, made some sense. At the end of the day even if they watched every episode they still likely wouldn't remember the foreshadowing about Nika, or make the parallel to the Celestrial dragons. 

However nowadays, since Oda has called back to it so much and it's much clearer now that Skypeia will have further significance and it wasn't just a side quest, nobody should be recommended anyone to skip it. But years ago I understood why someone would say it.",1141

15ieez7,"People who tell newbies to skip the Skypiea arc, what's wrong with you?",2023-08-04 22:43:45,"I've been in the fandom for a *long* time, so though I really don't agree with this stuff I can actually shed some insight into exactly why people give that advice:

Firstly, the biggest one is because for the longest time, Skypeia largely had no impact on the overall plot of the series, and for the most part it still hasn't had a direct impact beyond giving context for what Bellamy was up to after he left the story. From a lot of people's perspectives, the Strawhats might as well have gotten launched up in the knockup stream and just landed near Water Seven. The stuff that tied the events of Skypeia and Long Ring Long Land into the story really weren't obvious until *years* later.

Secondly, it really wasn't obvious about how much Skypeia tied into the thematic narrative of the story. Skypeia is from a narrative perspective, something of a thesis statement for the thematics of the series. ""Luffy is going to bring the dawn of the world and punch the fake gods who fucked up the world in the face"" is really how the series seems like it's going after Wano. Prior to even Whole Cake, it really wasn't clear that that was where Oda was planning on taking the series. For nearly the 20 years I've been reading it, a lot of people have been under the impression that One Piece will be a big adventure of how Luffy beats up the Four Emperors, finds the Great Treasure, and then the series ends. But it's becoming clearer and clearer that Skypeia was something of foreshadowing for how the series narrative is going to go. One Piece isn't the story of some magical fighting crackhead who will overthrow a government because some rando gave him half a grilled cheese sandwich, it's a story about how some magical fighting crackhead brings about the dawn of a new age of idealism by overthrowing an oppressive order that stole away the freedom of an entire world to live out their delusions of godhood.",1907

15ieez7,"People who tell newbies to skip the Skypiea arc, what's wrong with you?",2023-08-04 22:43:45,"It‚Äôs interesting because Skypiea is a turning point in the series in terms of tone.

Jaya sets up so much stuff regarding people on the Grand Line cluing in to the Straw hats, things that will pay off in Water 7 big time. 

Skypiea puts all that on hold, and introduces a new power system that just doesn't appeal to me when done one sided.

So I skipped it, enjoyed catching up, and then read up on it afterwards, enjoying the heck out of it.

Different people enjoy different things about the series, and there's no real point forcing yourself through something you're not enjoying when there's an absolute peak of an arc just around the corner.

15ieez7,"People who tell newbies to skip the Skypiea arc, what's wrong with you?",2023-08-04 22:43:45,"I think there's some merit to skipping arcs. Hear me out. I'm not a fan of skipping arcs, I rage against the Skypiea hate openly as it's one of my favourite arcs, same with Fishman Island. However, I also think One Piece has to be read twice specifically the first time to Marineford / ASL backstory and then restarting. The first time you go through One Piece should be for fun so if you get to Syrup village and you hate it? Usopp joins the crew somehow, if you get to Skypiea and hate it? They come back down from the sky with a whole lot of gold and a really damaged ship. They keep this up to Marineford they'll have too many questions and will have to re-read and by doing that they'll fall in love with the story all over again. Sure on the first read through we hated Usopp but on the second we can see why he's so terrified. Sure Long-Ring Long Land was extended for no good reason in the anime but the fight with Aokiji was insane! Sure Skypiea was another world but Luffy beat a GOD?! 

One piece is impossible to read as a segmented story but the story is so much fun that it can hold as one. I could start at any arc and have an amazing time because each arc is really well written and exemplify each of the characters involved. 

Again I don't agree with this method but I know it's brought people to the series and the more Nakama the merrier.

Beyond that, it has many themes that continue to resound throughout the story today such as inherited will, the idea of an evil world power taking away people's freedom, and the SUN GOD, for goodness sake. Not to mention world building. 

Anyone who writes that arc off just does not get the reason to enjoy this series. Must be just in it for the fights, or something.

I am currently rewatching with my Girlfriend and since it is her first time we watch everything but filler.

Honestly we both Love Skypiea on this rewatch.

There are so many great crew Interactions, the first part is extremly light hearted and it is one of the last arcs that has a real fun pirate adventure feel to it

I for one love most of post TS but for me it lacks that feeling of a goofy Pirate Crew going on a fun adventure for most of it since the stages are so much higher now so i really appreciate Skypiea for this",717

The arrival of a sun god that challenges the existing god. Check.

15ieez7,"People who tell newbies to skip the Skypiea arc, what's wrong with you?",2023-08-04 22:43:45,"It‚Äôs very long, very different from a lot of the other settings and arcs (and not in a way I found interesting), and frankly aside from the treasure (and the impact dials, which ironically make very little impact) it feels a lot like canon filler. You can skip it and have someone say ‚Äúyeah they found some treasure and here‚Äôs what these dial things do‚Äù and not miss much. The one exception I can remember off the top of my head would be the Klabautermann but that‚Äôs not tied to Skypeia, it‚Äôs just where it ended up getting foreshadowed.

Also, I find it weird how much love Enel gets when we had actual memorable villains like Crocodile and the Baroque Works crew right before him. I just found him annoying, and I wasn‚Äôt interested in his moon plot at all.

Overall it‚Äôs just way too long for way too little enjoyment. Alabasta was hitting that at points too.",861
15ieez7,"People who tell newbies to skip the Skypiea arc, what's wrong with you?",2023-08-04 22:43:45,"I've never told anyone to skip anything. But I have an idea of what the sentiment is behind the idea. 
When i first read OnePiece all those years ago, it was one of the first mangas I read, so i tried to run through it as fast as I can to catch up. I had read some weekly Marineford, but it left a lot of questions so I wanted to understand how we got there.

So running through the arcs until now you had the east blue that introduced the core quartet, and Alabasta, that gave us Chopper and, slightly more importantly, defeat of Crocodile. So up until now everything the SH's do has been either upgrading the crew or improving their notoriety and fame. These are obvious and noticeable changes that you can't miss and feel good.

Then we have Skypiea, which does not give us any new crew members, everything the crew does goes unnoticed outside the island by the givernment, and the crew don't get any immediate power ups. So the immediate feeling is that nothing really consequential happened. 
This is also the first truly outlandish island that we visit that challenges our understanding of how absurd and otherworldly the OP world is.

Only reading on you find out more and more about haki, the lost century, Joyboy and other themes that are introduced in this arc, but are expanded only much later on, but the immediate reaction is that nothing of consequence has happened, because little of what happened was explained.

So the notion that this arc can be skipped comes from a shallow reading of the material.",1517

15ieez7,"People who tell newbies to skip the Skypiea arc, what's wrong with you?",2023-08-04 22:43:45,"So, my hatred of it stems from this. I was getting ready to deploy to Afghanistan, I really needed to get my internet shut off and get everything prepared, as I was packing and what not I had been catching up on One Piece cause before this I had only gotten to see random episodes on Toonami years prior. I get to the Skypia arc. Over and over again I'm like, ""Yes! This is gonna be an epic battle!"" And over and over again I'm let down cause the boss battle kept getting postponed. I'm on a time crunch, spending every spare moment I can on One Piece. Then, after idk how long of watching Luffy chase after the bad guy, the big fight with massive, massive build up, is over so quick and didn't feel special at all. If I had died on that deployment, that would've been my last memory of One Piece. 

Now, after all these years, I do appreciate the arc for a lot of the back story and theories it provides, but I'll never watch that shit show of an arc again.",958

And I suppose it is really hard to cast and find similar looking people and also good actors. So I will hold on till series come out and how everything works in symphony, direction, scenes, acting, dialogue, music. 

Can it create one piece atmosphere and make us believe that it is actual one piece ü§î",395

15tmxxw,New Character Posters for the Live Action Series,2023-08-17 13:01:27,"Usopp without a long nose ruins the whole point of his character, without it Usopp wouldn't be Usopp. He's based on Pinocchio, and this matters a lot especially during his introductory arc, when there is a lot of focus on how much he lies to the village and to Kaya, in the form of all the stories he tells her. It's in his very name - ""uso"" is 'lie' in Japanese. It continues being important to his character in how the guy who is partly based on Pinocchio ends up having all of his lies become the truth, in some form or other.

And Enies Lobby is far away, yes, but Luffy not recognizing Sogeking without that obvious-as-hell long nose poking out of the mask wouldn't be nearly as funny.",690

15tmxxw,New Character Posters for the Live Action Series,2023-08-17 13:01:27,"I think it's TOO close to the manga. An adaptation should strive to ADAPT the original material to the medium, not just clone it. 

We're talking about bringing it into the human realm on television. Some over-the-top aspects of one piece won't translate well to the screen and the characters won't be credible.

Sanji's strand of hair looks ridiculous. They could easily have toned it down to something that an actual human would actually have as a hairstyle while still keeping it recognizable and specific to the character.

This looks like television actors trying to be cartoon characters, not television characters.

And from the trailers, I get that feeling from all the rest of the production : costumes, set designs, etc... There is such a thing as too faithful. I get they don't want to stray... But it's ok to make things more fitting",845

He‚Äôs running to the platform? Kick him away instead of like, making his light sword to cut him in half. 

He‚Äôs using the key to free Ace? Shoot the key instead of his head. 

He‚Äôs getting away with Law? Blindly shoot into the water and just let it be up to luck whether they die from it or not.

15rqh7d,Admiral Kizaru's Unclear Justice - The man with no dreams (Chapter 1090 Spoilers),2023-08-15 11:50:44,"This is really nice. Kizaru always struck me as someone who might have as well been a good guy. As a character, I think it's a great example of what happens when you get someone apathetic and with not much initiative into an inherently corrupt system. He's not a firm believer of the system like Sakazuki, nor a guy discouraged by it after he saw it at its worst and failed to change it, like Kuzan.

If you put a guy like Kizaru into the system, he's just gonna accept it and go with it. Cause without the will and organization to change the status quo, it is what it is.",572

Out of all the Admirals, Kizaru has been the one who seems fastest out the gates to crush dreams but something ALWAYS happens with him. Once the person he goes up against puts up enough of a fight, he just switches back to becoming an observer. It's actually so....UNCLEAR  


At Saoboady Archipelago - He kicks the Supernovas to pieces, takes his time with Zoro but then Rayleigh arrives and he basically backs down in a ""i did all I could"" sort of way but then  


One Piece: Film Z - He is the one out there to crush Zephyr, again it goes NOWHERE  


War of the Best: He's out there once again shooting lights at WB but after getting kicked by Marco, and a gun pointed at him by Beckman, he just sits there

  
Then One Piece: Red - Shanks haki-spanks and he once again goes away  


What is he going to do this time? this time its Sentomaru and Vegapunk, people he is actually close to. People have said Kizaru would be scary if he actually tried. He's not just going back in a ship with Saturn if the ""raid"" on Egghead fails.

15rqh7d,Admiral Kizaru's Unclear Justice - The man with no dreams (Chapter 1090 Spoilers),2023-08-15 11:50:44,"A better description would be that Kizaru is a 'roleplayer'. He plays whatever role he's given and he wants other people to play their chosen roles too and he won't tell them to *not* play their roles. This is what he meant by not betraying his ideals, if someone  has decided to change sides then he will respect that role and kill them no matter his personal history with them.

The 500 pirates he captured was because of his role as an Admiral, it's all about saving face and 'appearing' strong - Fujitora got in trouble with this because he refused to fake it but Kizaru doesn't care - he knows that the Admiral role is about projecting strength so he took the 500 pirates to make-up for losing straw-hats/Rayleigh.",719

He's always been closely associated with vegapunk, sentomaru or the pacifistas, even shown to have been acquainted with them since many years prior. The reason for them knowing each other hasn't been revealed in detail, yet. (Vegapunk is frankestein?)

Kizaru could just be what stussy is, an undercover agent or he could just genuinely be another clone finding its purpose? (An uncontrolled/free will variation? prototype?)

Aokiji was a morally decent human being, who could see the grey in criminals like Robin and the rest of the Strawhats. Akainu was the Absolute Justice fanatic who believed the ends justified the means and legality equated good and criminality to evil. Kizaru was just a guy doing his job and following orders. He fought who he was told to fight and didn't concern himself with the morality of the situation.

You can see them as the lawful good, lawful neutral and lawful evil spectrum, or representitive of general attitudes within the marines.

15rqh7d,Admiral Kizaru's Unclear Justice - The man with no dreams (Chapter 1090 Spoilers),2023-08-15 11:50:44,"I feel like the answer is much simpler. His Justice is to follow the orders given unless they're annoying or time-consuming in which case he'd rather pawn it off to someone else; in other words, 'Convenient Justice' lol. 

I see him more like Shikamaru's character in that while he's incredibly capable, anything that makes him exert more than minimal effort is a 'drag', so he does it if its easy or quick or gives it to someone else otherwise. Even the vivre card part about preferring to follow orders rather than lead; because leading is a 'pain' and you'd have to manage more than just yourself; its easier & quicker to do it himself if he has to be involved no matter what.

Oh its Rayleigh? I didn't sign up to fight an actual threat; Pacifista, go get 'em

Oh Marco can regenerate and is keeping me occupied? This is annoying....until he's got cuffs on, *then* I'll press the attack

Oh its Ben Beckman? Guess I'll let them work this out and sit here instead

I know its noncanon, but 'Oh, Uta is singing Tot Musica? Well no point in fightning now, I yield'

Why did he go out and capture 500 pirates after being denied the Strawhats? Probably because the higherups, and especially the Celestial Dragons, chewed him out for letting 3 Supernova escape (one of whom decked the \*\*\*\* out of Charloss) and saddled him with work out the wazoo.  If he went out to 'vent his rage' I'd sooner believe it was because he was saddled with 'way too much work' as punishment so he took it out on every other pirate on Sabaody in hopes of reducing the extra workload.

As for why he asked he should head out to Wano, I would chalk it up to boredom or wanting to get away from paperwork. They clearly already have 2 Admirals out of HQ constantly (Fujitora & Uh...Treebeard; whatever that guys name is); Aokiji Defected (or is working DEEP undercover for Sword or as one of those Knights we just heard about); and Akainu is heading everything up so Kizaru is probably just stuck at HQ constantly and bored out of his mind.

I know mine is a lot of guesswork and supposition, but to be honest, I feel like it fits what we know about him more than 'He's secretly looking for his goal in life'.",2186

15rqh7d,Admiral Kizaru's Unclear Justice - The man with no dreams (Chapter 1090 Spoilers),2023-08-15 11:50:44,"Borsalino is a company, specifically a company that makes hats. They primarily make Fedoras which were associated with mobsters and their opposites, Detectives. Essentially Borsalino is a name associated with old 1950's detectives which i believe is something Kizaru is meant to evoke. Even his kind of justice Unclear Justice evokes it. The answer isn't clear but he'll end up sleuthing it out eventually.

I think with this in mind Kizaru evokes a lot of Columbo imagery having the appearance of a bumbling simpleton who's secretly one of the smartest or in this case strongest people around.

A lot of what this post describes brings up the imagery of the melancholy detective wondering if what they're doing is right. I can picture Kizaru sitting in a dark room with the only light being a street light shining out of the... thing. I legit just spent five fucking minutes googling what these things are called and found nothing and it's completely ruined my fucking day but you get what i mean. He's a detective and he's in the same mindset a lot of those detectives are in old novels and movies like you get in thinking you can make a difference but by the end you're just a cog in the machine and powerless to help the people you know you should.",1252

I will add that with the 500 pirates... he was sent there to do a job. If you fail one objective, you make damn sure to complete the task well, so your superiors won't get mad. This would reflect on his 'corporate' nature well.

That said, with his design, I see him less as a businessman and more like a yakuza man. Sakazuki would be his oyabun, while he's the muscle. Has respect for others, but is there to do his job and cash-in the paycheck. 

It remains to be seen whether he is truly insecure about his lack of goals and curious of others, or if he accepted it. Ambition is tumultuous, you can be much more peaceful when you don't desire much.",734

My read on Kizaru is that he's someone who's never really cared enough about anything, and he has no interest in wanting to start. I bet that he became strong without having to put much effort into it, then he ate a super powerful Devil Fruit that made fighting even easier for him.

Having to think about the nature of justice and what HE wants is too much effort for him, he wants everything to stay easy, so he just blindly follows orders because things are simpler that way.

I see him as emblematic of the apathy that helps enable the WG to do so many awful things.

Also, no way is he getting defeated this arc. There will probably be a scuffle with Luffy, but Kizaru isn't losing until endgame.",720

Some people just don't have them: goals, dreams, etc. You can't just forcefully squish it out of yourself and then sincerely believe in it. His voice acting really highlights this attitude imo. The life is just a temporary silly activity, where you try to suffer the less. If you don't go for your dream, you would suffer from regret.

They are said to do not more than needed. They are lazy. Sometimes they get show some interest in work when it is clear they won't get ordered to do that work.

Kizaru just fullfills orders he gets.
If he can't fullfill his orders he looks for compensation.
Beeing just a gear in the machine or a corporate slave might also hint to a big backgroundstory like Senor Pink had.

Maybe Kizaru lost someone (his brother?) because of an ignored order, or rebellious behavior. That made Kizaru see, that there is no mercy from the worldgovernment  or chance to rebell up. So he just does what he has to do.

Maybe that's the reason Sentomaru calls him uncle, he is his uncle and Sentomarus dad the one Kizaru lost. 

I also think Kizaru will take the chance to let flee  Sentomaru if the opportunity comes without him actively act against his orders.
A bit like Garp trying to stop Luffy in Marineford.
Thinking of the latest chapters Garp would have easily onehitted Luffy. And Garp wanting to kill Akainu makes much more sense now, because now we know that he would have been capable of doing so.",1163

 He almost died against Magellan then barely survived after having his body torn apart and rebuilt for hours, then got hopped up on tension hormones from Ivankov, fought his way out of Impel Down, fought dozens of high ranking Marine officers, including getting jumped by several vice admirals, got kicked and lasered by Kizaru, at some point took another dose of hormones, kept fighting towards the platform, fought his way out with Ace, and finally had his spirit broken by losing him and got severe burns right in the middle of his chest while Jinbe got pierced through the shoulder, and the difference between their initial conditions meant that the chest injury was far rougher on Luffy than the shoulder injury was on Jinbe. Oh, and that's ignoring the strain of repeatedly using his Gears, especially Gear 2.
 
Luffy had simply taken far too much abuse, and was in critical condition, but what Hawkins noticed is that there was always a way out for him. In his escape the Whitebeard pirates organized themselves to defend him, Jinbe did everything he could to protect him, Crocodile and Buggy protected him, Shanks showed up to end the war, Law took him in under his care and Boa Hancock followed after them tp guarantee they'd make it out safely and even give Luffy a proper place to recover.

Less boring answer, we were told on Fishman Island Luffy would destroy it. Oda made a point to revisit Shyarly's predictions, showing she was extremely accurate about everything when Roger saw her, and even at the time Camie notes it might happen in the future. Oda is absolutely going to revisit this eventually. Since we already know some portion of the future is decided, Luffy can't actually die until the predicted time happens. He can almost certainly die afterwards though.

I agree you'd likely be able to find it if they worked like this. But with the One Piece world the way it is, there are so many more factors to consider than x and y Co ordinates on a 2D plane.

If could be in the sky or sunk underwater or be trapped in a time rift created by a devil fruit. Any number of things could make it vastly more complicated than excluding a quarter of the centuries of hidden clues.

There are very strong problems with your assumptions, but the most important one, WHY EVERYONE ASSUME LAST PONEGLYPH IS THE ONE MOVING TO THE OTHER THREE. 

In reality, you dont have all info, (redundant ik) so lets suppose you are right and they are coordinates thay hit eachother.

What about if the last poneglyp is just another static point and the point you should be using for doing a full travel to the triangle, is just another one?? 

You would think that travelling across a triangle is not that hard but it is, because is hard to travel straight linea in new world, you just use log pose to get to island as much, and thats still hard, how would you manage to travel to all diferent 4 triangles that can be formed by moving 1 dot and leaving all others static?

We just assume the last one takes that role out of nothing, really.

Not going to hard on you, is just something that already have been discused.


Let alone if one dot is not in the ground, but again..you would not have a single triangle and one dot moving to mimic it, you would not know what every dot does and how their incoporate themselves to the equation. 

You would have, again, 4 possibilities, in which everytime you use one dot to do the moving technique. Now to that, assume one triangle is already a big land to cover and impossible to go straight lines, now add 3 MORE, complete madness.",1422

This is why you need 4, because it gives you an exact location so you know it's there. Going to ""travel within the lines"" is absurd, it's like you dont know how the Grand Line works. Especially the New World which is so insane to navigate you need 3 log poses instead of 1.

You are assuming that you know which specific 3 Poneglyths you need to reach Laugh Tale, but in theory you might need the 4th one because one of the 3 that you process is useless, because you would form a different triangle with different position.

Another thing you need to assume as well is that the world is a globe, not a 2D plane. What happens if each coordinate is in each Blue Sea for example? Can you trace the same triangle and reach Laugh Tale?

I sometime ago made a post about this as well and reached a different conclusion than you (with a theory of my own as well, that probably is wrong), but I think you should check it out.",702

For those who ""debunked"" this,

1. ""The lode poneglyph may not point to coordinate and also may contain a specific instructions""
As some have pointed out, Robin in Zou said it that those poneglyphs are indeed pointing to a coordinate. But i do agree it might contain more details as to how to access it, such as a specific time or requiring something special (basically no one knows, there is a big IF, so i can accept this, but the this theory is still veru much be true).

2. ""One piece is in a 3D world, yadadada""
This theory can still be applied in a 3D world. I honestly dont think that the intersection is trully an intersection. I think it is much more possible for the lines to intersect if it is being projected onto a 2D plane. In real world, we also mapped onto a 2D plane, only after we have technology can we make a 3D map. And in Onepiece, yes there are technology and stuff like cyborgs, and whatever is in Egghead, but I dont really see Nami navigate the ship using a computer. The point being this theory is still valid in a 3D world.

3. ""Raftel can be very much located in the sky or underwater""
This implies that the intersection between lode poneglyphs is actually an accurate point in a 3D plane. Which is of course possible and I accept this view, but I would still like to point out that Raftel is an island, and i havent seen a tiny island in Onepiece (of course Raftel might be the first case). Being a massive structure, it is probably not that difficult to spot if there is a crew member with the ability to explore such area (maybe a crew member who can fly? Or maybe a crew member who is a fishman *cough* jimbe *cough* or who can speak to fish?). 
I am not a diehard One piece fan, so I dont really remember how they discovered Skypiea, but a brief google search tell me that they need to use some sort of a gate? And I think surely this huge gate is visible from somewhere. If there is a massive structure in the middle of nowhere, might as well see what is in there.

4. ""The lines of the triangle may be really huge, it is impossible to trace it, especially if need to check the sky and underwater as well""
Again, i am no OP diehard fan, but i think Raftel should be in the Grand Line, right? So we actually dont have to trace everything!, we just need to explore areas within the Grand Line. Although it is still a very difficult task, but if you have no clue as to where is the last lode poneglyph, this idea is very much the best bet you have (of course suddenly Kid got a lead about the man marked by flames....).

5. ""Sailing to trace the triangle line is impossible in Grand Line because of the log pose will only point to the nearest island chain it locked into)
True, for that I have no excuse lol.. But i think in the wiki it is mentioned that the locked log pose will only reset if it stays in the locked island for a period of time, soo... just dont go there? Turn back and try again from the previous island hahaha..
In the wiki it is stated that the log pose is a one-way compass, cannot go back to the previous island, but i wonder why? A needle has 2 ends, if one is locked into your destination, the end should point to where you were, no (?).

Again the point if it might be easier to try this
Method if they dont have any lead as to where is the location of the fourth poneglyph.

The poneglyphs may be self referential in their explanations such that you can only form a triangle or cross once you have all 4.

One of the poneglyphs - already possessed or outstanding - may contain information, instructions, or conditions which are not strictly related to location.

They may form a partial pattern or shape, such as 4 points or a pentagram, with the final portion or node being represented by Laughtale.

My guess is that while this is in all likelihood a possibility, the writings ON the road poneglyphs teach us the actual manner with which log poses are used to get to Laugh Tale.

&#x200B;

However, I don't think it's that simple.  


There are a number of ways where it can be impossible to find the last island without all 4 poneglyphs. One for example: What if you are given coordinates for the 4 marked locations, but only split up? What I mean is: let's call the poneglyphs A,B,C,D, and the 4 coordinates as Co1,Co2,Co3,C4. Poneglyph A might only contain the x-coordinate of Co1, with maybe the y-coordinate of Co2. So if you take the 3 coordinates from Poneglyphs A,B, and C, you'd only have some combination of coordinates. Now all you have to do is set it up so any 3 poneglyphs you find, contain more than 1 incomplete set of coordinates. For example, ending up with only Co1x, Co2y,   Co3x, Co4y, Co1y, and Co2x  \[Co3y, Co4x\]. Now with 3 poneglyphs, each containing 2 non-matched coordinates, only give you a full set of 2 marked locations. In fact, this guarantees that any 3 poneglyphs you find, you will always be missing 2 complete marked locations. Because if you have 2 un-matched coordinates in each Poneglyph, then the 4th missing one will always mean you are missing 2 of the marked locations

&#x200B;

Anyway, then there's the fact that sky islands and at least 1 underwater island exist to consider. If these coordinates contain 3 coordinates, an x, y, and z, then we really can't find the location with just 3 poneglyphs.  


Then what others have mentioned which is that there is possibly some other condition to reach the last island aside from just having 4 marked locations.

&#x200B;

Another thing to consider is that these poneglyphs are huge. They have what seems to be A LOT of text. And up until now, Oda has not actually shown us any real way of decyphering them. Robin simply looks at a giant block, and claims she knows what it says. Obviously I believe her lol, but my point is that we can assume it's a lot of text to read through. I think it's weird that these 4 poneglyphs that contain coordinates, would only contain that. If so, wouldn't it just be a giant block with like 1 or 2 lines of the language written? Instead, they're still a complete block of text. So there's really no way for us to tell how easy, or difficult, or possible/impossible it is unless Robin fully explained the contents of the poneglyphs that she's translated so far.",2334

16827vp,One of Onteresting Original Item from the Live Action,2023-09-02 13:12:46,"The Babel fish is small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy received not from its own carrier but from those around it. It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to nourish itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with the nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain which has supplied them. The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language. The speech patterns you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your Babel fish.

Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mindbogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen it to see it as a final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God.

The argument goes something like this: ""I refuse to prove that I exist,"" says God, ""for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing."" ""But,"" says Man, ""the Babel fish is a dead giveaway isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.""

""Oh dear,"" says God, ""I hadn't thought of that,"" and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.
""Oh, that was easy,"" says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets killed on the next zebra crossing.",1538

Sanji i liked alot more he had the sanji flare pretty well. Usopp and nami were great. These 3 really carried it for me. I did wish sanji was more bright and excited talking about the all blue since he is one of the more sillier ones.

I kept wondering where I recognised him from and Wikipedia revealed to me he had been a major character in a British soap opera I *used* to watch with my family.\*

Anyway, when I got to Skypeia it hit me that this anime for children and teens was unironically better written and more entertaining than this prime time high production soap opera from the biggest media company in Britain. I stopped watching the show after that, and spent the 30 mins I saved each night watching One Piece instead.

But for moments like Zeff waving goodbye to sanji, as I picture it from the view of someone who has never seen the show, it just doesn't land as hard as it does in the anime and manga, because there was the luxury of having chapters and episodes to build zeff and sanjis relationship, and we just don't have that luxury here. Now the LA has done an amazing job truly, but as a long time one piece fan, I have fond memories of Baratie and Zeff, and the crew, and I just don't think any first time watchers are going to get that same experience from the LA.",708

For example when he plays dead so the fishman leaves him alone he just gets up out of nowhere with no explanation and one shots him. I wish they at least showed his internal monologue so that you see how he was going to simply play dead to survive but decides he wants to do his part even if he‚Äôs terrified.",569

166zid4,Live action character tier list by how much I liked their performances.,2023-09-01 06:38:38,"For me the best characters were zoro and nami they carried the show for me along with buggy and mihawk. With luffy he was hit or miss for meprobably because his fight scenes could be very wonky at times and zoros fight scenes outshone luffys everytime. Usopp and sanji portrayed there characters well but it felt like both of their arcs baratie and syrupp villiage zoro was the main focus and while it was awesome for zoro usopp and sanji kinda faded into the background for me. Although sanji had the best backstory. So to summarize

LA PRESENT: Zoro > Nami > Luffy > Sanji > Usopp

LA BACKSTORIES: Sanji > Zoro > Nami > Usopp > Luffy

Surpringly I thought Zoros backstory was better than the manga and made it more epic with him trying to climb out of the well also the kuina zoro duel was also really good. Sanji's backstory I liked the most because of how faithful it was to the manga. Nami's backstory felt rushed and there was no time to build up to arlong arriving so when he killed her mum I felt nothing. Usopps backstory was good but I felt the child actor was really bad and didnt hit me as much as It could of and Luffy's backstory is the worst just because of bad writing and it was all over the place pacing wise",1226

Honestly, the only actors who I felt were off were the Nyaoban brothers. But their characters were good it‚Äôs just the poor/sloppy combat let them down. Now I get it, it has to be ‚Äújazzed up‚Äù for TV but I honestly feel that Makenyu was so far beyond their skill he made them look bad.

I mean 10/10 performance! she really set the tone perfectly for evil pirate, felt like a pirate boss, and the focus on reputation over beauty is a great and grounded change for the motivation.      Just as a comparison from manga to adaptation it‚Äôs a little surprising she showed zero vanity and instead  had a hyper-inflated sense of her own notoriety.

His hair being unique and more absurd each arc is what really cemented it for me as being perfect. The buzzed head was a tragedy and should only exist to segue into the reveal of Franky Salon when they all reunited. The lack of hair robs so much of Franky's *SUPER* vibe and the fact that it's always used as his default look for promotional material now kills me a little inside each time I see it.

It just fits Franky's personality, backstory and motivation way better. Not to mention that it lets Oda do wacky and funny things with him, like all the different haircuts he uses.

The shirt hair is a problem for most people...even though he only has it for a few scenes in the Return to Seabody arc. After that he pretty has a different wacky haircut in each arc. There's an argument to be made that the fact that the Fishman Island designs for the Straw Hats pretty much became their ""Base post timeskip designs"" has always been a bad idea.",717

15j7jhx,Your opinion on post time skip Franky's design ?,2023-08-05 21:38:45,"Personally speaking the design of all the Grand Line acquired crew mates got worse after timeskip. Getting used to them, but still pretty bad.

Franky and Brook just have too much stuff going on, literally ""over designed"", the simpler pre timeskip looks were much more effective. Chopper became a doll/plushie and Robin is just plain, almost an afterthought, she's the prototype One Piece fan service girl, nothing interesting in her post timeskip design at all.

Also Nami's new design would have been pretty good, had she not been sexualized way more. Unfortunately Sueisha editors (or maybe Oda, who knows) cannot believe you can sell a manga to teenage boys without shoving quadruple D bosoms in their faces 24/7.

I like the other Nakama's post timeskip design better though.",780

Now the forearms also funktions as Toolboxes which i love. I like his Chain fist has flames on it. I like how it has smaller functional hands. Shoulder missiles are way better (old version was uncanny as heck).  The desing is make him look cool and Functional.

The fact is we almost never see him use that form for combat. I would have preferred a more simple human design and doubled down on the robotics. 

I think Shogun Franky is underwhelming, and definitely doesn't go toe to toe with any major world players. I think the docking joke was a great idea but it could have been removing parts of his body and replacing them with adaptable combat forms.",449

His previous design still fitted the character, people still though he was weird, but he didn‚Äôt really look like a cyborg, he had big arms, but that was really it (and in one piece, you can look like anything and be classified as ‚Äúhuman‚Äù)

But the new design is so in your face weird, which is just like franky, when people see him, they aren‚Äôt supriswd he is a cyborg, they are just surprised to be around a cyborg. His hairstyle is a constant gag with it changing constantly (like being a (non functional) cannon in dressrosa) the new design is a shock, and franky himself is a shock.

Red and sphere shoulders then blue and cubic arms. I don't know what Oda is thinking, but he knows it's designed chaotically.

One thing that can fix this, is an actual robotic PANTS. It will fix the body proportions. And if there's a similar design to the shoulders and arms, it would negate the inconsistency. Not that Franky would want to wear pants tho.",468

Definitely one of the less offensive changes in personality post-ts.

Looks-wise? I would've been ok with the bulk up if he also had big legs... This guy is the very definition of skipping leg day, it just looks awful. Also disliked the buzz but every other hairstyle that he has rocked post-ts has been good.

So yeah he looks worse but that's because he skipped leg day. Only other sh designs that I had a problem with were Nami and Chopper post-ts though.",627

After his battle Frankys got misused when he was a kid and he was told that he had to be accountable for the things he makes (although he should always be proud of what he makes) Franky pretty much made sure that the only Battle Franky that could be used afterwards was himself, and he'd be in control of his weapons and how they're used.

He made a lot of modifications to his body to be a Battle Franky to improve himself and help his crew. I know a lot of people don't like the design when it's revealed post time skip, but it's important to have this info in mind because it makes more sense!

Although, I agree with a lot of ppl that I preferred his other hair. But Franky is still Franky regardless haha, so I do love him.",825

1670m8v,My wife asked why I got teary-eyed when Shanks was talking to Luffy,2023-09-01 07:44:47,I got choked up 3-4 times now watching the first 4 episodes. I thought something was wrong with me since I recently became a father. Maybe some mixed emotions etc. But reading all these comments im glad im not alone in this one. Outside of the fillers and stuff at its core one piece still is a masterpiece. It felt nostalgic seeing the first episodes after literally watching it as a kid and now still reading (manga) with a kid.,430
1670m8v,My wife asked why I got teary-eyed when Shanks was talking to Luffy,2023-09-01 07:44:47,"What hit me was the introduction of the one piece op1 song appeared  when the going merry departs. I wasn't expecting it and I've never EVER have fallen for that kinda shit in any sort of show or game with nostalgia bait.

This would stem from the fact that I'm half Hong Kong Chinese. And one piece started when I was 3 or 4  by the time I was 5 I was watching the first episodes of one piece in Japanese with subtitles in canto, so that theme was deep seated within my psyche. 

For some reason I didn't think it would happen in the show. And to use it when Luffy gets his ship was just nuts.",594

Personally my favorite character portrayal was Buggy, the actor nailed that shit. Everyone else was great too. Zeff = Gordon Ramsay in my head canon and it's amazing. Overall I've not seen the beginning of the anime for a good ten-ish years now so it felt like I was almost coming into this with a fresh mind and it was great. There were quite a few tear jerker moments I have to admit, the nami scene in coco village was the biggest one for me. 

I know the general story outline but had forgotten quite a few of the smaller details so it was a nice refresher and it makes me want to rewatch the whole anime again from the beginning.",806

Maybe it's because I m used to the big pauses and the soundtrack in these scenes while watching the anime.

There's a lot of things the LA did differently but the one thing they captured perfectly was each character's *aura*. Every single one of them, despite the differences, practically leaps right off the pages of the manga. And that is possibly the best compliment I can think of for the series.

15jvjc0,A friend of mine is claiming that this moment of Luffy is copied from Eren.,2023-08-06 17:40:06,"i dont know wether its copied or not, but the paralells between the scenes are quite interesting. For both eren and luffy, these are the moments where they feel the very feeling that they have aspired for a long time: freedom. But the twist is, that their ideas of the freedom that they are feeling are opposed to each other - these moments represent two opposing ideas of how to deal with the world. 

Both eren and luffy come up in similar positions: Both live in a restrictive world that naturally opresses them and prevents them from doing what they please and endangers their loved ones. Eren wants to go outside of the wall while luffy wants to go out to the sea. Erens first obstacle is the wall, once he overcomes the wall he realizes that the real opression comes from the people outside of the wall - luffy has to overcome the red line, once he enters the grand line he realizes that there are powerful foes like the yonkos, shichibukai and admirals that are trying to prevent him  from beeing free. 

At one point, after eren had seen many of his peers and friends die, decideds to simply destroy everything apart from his home, in order to protect his friends and be finally free (which means nobody can be there to try to opress him and kill his friends) - a rather rationalist intention, which he persues by acting completely on his own while excluding his friends from his plans. While eren plans to kill everyone to achieve freedom, luffy does the opposite: he saves everyone to achieve freedom. Erens plan is to take away everyone elses freddom so he can be the only one to have it while luffy achieves freedom by giving it to the world. 

Luffy frees all people and creates a world where everyone is laughing and free - This is his freedom; Eren takes away everyones freedom and creates a world of terror and fear - this is his freedom: so basically two sides of the same coin.",1895
